### Augmented Case \- Urticarial Vasculitis

---

## Case Description

A 30-year-old woman presents to the outpatient clinic with a two-week history of an itchy rash on her arms and legs, accompanied by joint pain and mild fatigue. She reports that the rash appears as red, raised patches that resemble hives but last longer than typical hives, often persisting for over 24 hours before slowly fading. The patient mentions that the patches leave behind a bruise-like discoloration as they resolve. She also experiences stiffness and aching in her wrists and knees, especially in the morning, along with mild fatigue.

## Stage 1: Initial Case Presentation

### Required Patient History Questions

1. When did the rash first appear, and how has it changed over time?  
2. Have you noticed anything unusual after the rash resolves, like bruising or discoloration?  
3. Have you been exposed to new medications, environments, or foods recently?  
4. Do you feel stiff or achy in your joints at specific times of the day?

### Physical Examination Findings

- **Relevant**:  
  - **Skin Examination**:  
    - Red, raised patches on her forearms and legs, some with fading bruising; slightly tender but not painful.  
  - **Musculoskeletal Examination**:  
    - Mild tenderness in the wrists and knees but no noticeable swelling or warmth. Full range of motion preserved.  
  - **Vitals Check**:  
    - Height: 165 cm, Weight: 60 kg, BMI: 22.0 (Normal).  
    - Temperature: 37.2°C (98.9°F), Pulse: 80/min, Blood Pressure: 118/76 mm Hg.  
- **Irrelevant**:  
  - Neurological Examination: No abnormalities detected.  
  - Respiratory Examination: Normal breath sounds.

## Stage 2: Primary Diagnosis and Reasoning

### Expected Primary Diagnosis

- Urticarial Vasculitis.

### Key Reasoning Points

1. **Clinical Features**: Persistent hives lasting over 24 hours and resolving with bruising, accompanied by joint pain and fatigue.  
2. **Family History**: Rheumatoid arthritis in the mother suggests possible autoimmune predisposition.  
3. **Physical Findings**: Persistent rash with post-lesional bruising and mild joint tenderness.

### Common Errors to Anticipate

- Misdiagnosing as chronic idiopathic urticaria without considering the duration and post-lesional bruising.  
- Ignoring systemic symptoms like fatigue and joint pain, which indicate an autoimmune process.

## Stage 3: Differential Diagnoses

### Correct

1. Urticarial Vasculitis  
2. Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) with cutaneous manifestations  
3. Hypersensitivity Vasculitis

### Incorrect

1. Chronic Idiopathic Urticaria  
2. Drug-Induced Urticarial Rash

### Descriptions for Differential Diagnoses

1. **Urticarial Vasculitis (Correct)**: Fits the persistent rash and post-lesional discoloration.  
2. **SLE with Cutaneous Manifestations (Correct)**: Possible given fatigue and joint pain but less likely without systemic features.  
3. **Hypersensitivity Vasculitis (Correct)**: Could be related to allergens but ruled out by history.  
4. **Chronic Idiopathic Urticaria (Incorrect)**: Less likely due to post-lesional bruising and systemic symptoms.  
5. **Drug-Induced Urticarial Rash (Incorrect)**: Unlikely without recent medication changes.

## Stage 4: Diagnostic Testing and Interpretation

### Curated Test Options

- **Correct**:  
  1. Complete Blood Count (CBC) and ESR: Detects inflammation.  
  2. ANA Test: Identifies autoimmune activity.  
  3. Complement Levels (C3, C4): Low levels suggest urticarial vasculitis.  
  4. Skin Biopsy: Reveals leukocytoclastic vasculitis with immune deposits.  
- **Incorrect**:  
  1. Allergy Panel Testing: Irrelevant given no new exposures.  
  2. Imaging: Not relevant for this case.

### Expected Test Results

2. **CBC and ESR**: Mildly elevated ESR, indicating inflammation.  
3. **Complement Levels (C3, C4)**: Low levels typical of urticarial vasculitis.  
4. **ANA Test**: Positive in cases with underlying autoimmune conditions.  
5. **Skin Biopsy**: Leukocytoclastic vasculitis with immunoglobulin deposits.

### Optional Additional Tests

- Rheumatoid Factor: Could support an autoimmune etiology but not directly confirmatory.  
- Anti-dsDNA and Anti-Sm Antibodies: Consider for systemic lupus erythematosus if systemic signs emerge.

## Stage 5: Final Diagnosis and Feedback

### Expected Final Diagnosis

- Urticarial Vasculitis.

### Key Supporting Evidence

1. Persistent hives with bruising after resolution.  
2. Low complement levels and positive ANA.  
3. Biopsy confirming leukocytoclastic vasculitis.

### Feedback Suggestions

#### Correct Diagnosis Feedback

1. **Highlight the Key Clinical Features**:  
   - "You identified the hallmark features of urticarial vasculitis: hives lasting over 24 hours, post-lesional bruising, and systemic symptoms like fatigue and joint pain."  
2. **Reinforce Pathophysiology**:  
   - "This condition involves immune complex deposition in small blood vessels, leading to inflammation and vascular damage."  
3. **Encourage Diagnostic Confidence**:  
   - "Your reasoning demonstrated strong diagnostic skills by linking the clinical features to autoimmune pathology."

#### Incorrect Diagnosis Feedback

1. **Address Misinterpretation**:  
   - "Chronic idiopathic urticaria resolves within 24 hours and does not leave bruising. Joint pain and fatigue are also atypical."  
2. **Refocus on Systemic Features**:  
   - "When systemic symptoms like fatigue accompany skin findings, consider autoimmune conditions."  
3. **Provide Corrective Learning Resources**:  
   - "Review autoimmune conditions like urticarial vasculitis and their diagnostic workup."
