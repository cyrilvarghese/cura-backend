## Master Clinical Case: Leprosy Type 1 Reaction (Reversal Reaction)


### **Part 1: Case Description**


**Patient Profile:**


- Age: 31 years  
- Gender: Male  
- Occupation: Agricultural worker  
- Residence: Rural endemic area in South India


**Chief Complaint:**  
Sudden swelling, redness, and pain over pre-existing skin lesions with new nerve pain in the right hand for 1 week.


**History of Present Illness:**  
The patient presents with new-onset skin lesions consistent with borderline tuberculoid leprosy and has not yet started MDT. One week ago, he noticed acute inflammation of the lesions along with pain and swelling over the right ulnar nerve. He describes the pain as burning and constant, with associated weakness in gripping objects.


He denies fever, joint pain, or nasal symptoms. No similar past episodes. This is his first presentation with leprosy-related symptoms.


**Past Medical History:**


- No significant past medical history


**Family History:**


- No known leprosy among contacts


**Social History:**


- Lives with extended family, works in farming


**Review of Systems:**


- Skin: Redness, swelling, and tenderness in patches  
- Neurological: Ulnar nerve pain, motor weakness in right hand  
- General: No systemic signs

### **Part 2: Primary Symptoms**


1. Erythema and edema of existing skin lesions  
2. New nerve pain and tenderness (neuritis)  
3. Paresthesia or hypoesthesia over ulnar distribution  
4. Motor weakness in affected limb  
5. No new lesions  
6. No systemic constitutional symptoms (fever usually absent)

### **Part 3: Relevant Background Information**


- No known prior diagnosis of leprosy  
- Likely immunological upgrading response to *M. leprae* antigens  
- Occurs in borderline spectrum (BT \> BB \> BL)  
- Can present before or after MDT initiation


---


### **Part 4: Master Physical Examination List**


- Skin exam (inflamed plaques or patches) — ⚡️ Mandatory image  
- Palpation of peripheral nerves (ulnar, radial cutaneous)  
- Muscle strength testing of hand  
- Reflexes (ulnar nerve distribution)  
- Sensory exam with pinprick and temperature  
- Eye and facial exam (check for early CN involvement)


---


### **Part 5: Master Lab Test List**


- Slit-skin smear (to assess BI, not for diagnosis of reaction) — ⚡️ Mandatory image  
- Skin biopsy (to confirm granulomatous inflammation, perivascular lymphocytic infiltration, and dermal edema typically seen in Type 1 reactions) — ⚡️ Mandatory image  
- CBC, LFT, RFT (baseline for steroids)  
- Fasting glucose (if steroids planned)  
- Nerve conduction study (if neuritis persists or worsens)  
- ESR, CRP (optional, to confirm inflammation)  
- HIV (baseline in all leprosy cases)

### **Part 6: History and Findings**


**Key Questions:**


- When did symptoms of redness/swelling begin?  
- Was MDT being taken regularly?  
- Any weakness or tingling in the hand?  
- Any similar past episodes?  
- Family or contacts with leprosy?  
- Are the lesions painful or only swollen?  
- Do you have any difficulty using your hand or fingers?  
- Have you noticed any numbness in other areas?  
- Have you had any vision changes or eye discomfort?  
- Are you experiencing fatigue or night sweats?


**Vitals:** Normal


**Findings:**


- Erythematous, swollen skin lesions over arms  
- Right ulnar nerve thickened and tender  
- Weak grip strength on right hand  
- Sensory loss over ulnar distribution  
- No signs of systemic illness

### **Part 7: Primary Diagnosis**


**Type 1 Reaction (Reversal Reaction)**


- Occurs in borderline forms  
- Sudden inflammation of existing lesions and nerves  
- No new lesions or systemic signs


---


### **Part 8: Differential Diagnoses**


**Correct:**


- Type 1 Lepra Reaction (Primary)  
- Nerve abscess (if swelling progresses or localized)


**Incorrect:**


- ENL (Type 2 Reaction – associated with systemic symptoms and new nodules)  
- Cellulitis (usually has systemic signs, no nerve involvement)  
- Contact dermatitis (itchy, no nerve symptoms)


---


### **Part 9: Diagnostic Testing and Interpretation**


- **Slit-skin smear:** Low BI expected (borderline tuberculoid case) — ⚡️ Mandatory image  
- **Skin biopsy:** Shows granulomatous inflammation, dermal edema, and perivascular lymphocytic infiltration — ⚡️ Mandatory image  
- **CBC:** Normal or mild leukocytosis  
- **LFT/RFT:** Baseline before steroids  
- **Fasting glucose:** To assess steroid safety  
- **Nerve conduction studies:** May show acute neuritis (reduced velocity, conduction block)

### **Part 10: Final Diagnosis**


**Type 1 Lepra Reaction in Newly Diagnosed Borderline Tuberculoid Leprosy**


- Confirmed by inflamed lesions and acute neuritis

### **Part 12: Management & Treatment Plan**


### 🧪 Pre-Treatment and Monitoring Investigations


| Investigation | Purpose | Relevant Drug(s) |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| CBC | Baseline for infection or leukocytosis | Prednisolone |
| LFTs | Monitor hepatic safety on steroids | Prednisolone |
| RFTs | Rule out renal compromise before meds | Prednisolone |
| Blood glucose | Screen for steroid-induced hyperglycemia | Prednisolone |
| Slit-skin smear | Not useful for reaction, but part of leprosy f/u | — |
| HIV Test | General baseline in leprosy | — |
| Nerve conduction study | Document nerve involvement | — |


### 🔁 Monitoring During Reaction Treatment


| Time Point | Test | Purpose | Relevant Drug(s) |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Weekly | Clinical nerve palpation | Track resolution of neuritis | Prednisolone |
|  | Grip strength/sensory testing | Detect progression or improvement | Prednisolone |
| Every 2–4 Weeks | Blood glucose | Steroid-induced hyperglycemia | Prednisolone |
| Monthly | CBC, LFT | Monitor steroid toxicity | Prednisolone |


**Treatment Protocol:**


- **First-line:**  
    
  - **Prednisolone 40–60 mg/day** for 2–4 weeks, tapered over 12 weeks




- **Second-line options (if steroids contraindicated or inadequate):**  
    
  - **Methotrexate:** 7.5–15 mg/week (used off-label, under specialist supervision)  
  - **Azathioprine:** 1–2 mg/kg/day (for steroid-sparing effect)  
  - **Cyclosporine:** 3–5 mg/kg/day (reserved for resistant neuritis)




- Continue standard MDT (Rifampicin \+ Dapsone ± Clofazimine depending on classification)


**Supportive Care:**


- Physiotherapy to maintain hand function  
- Patient education on nerve care  
- Protective footwear


**Prognosis:**


- Good if treated early  
- Risk of permanent nerve damage if reaction untreated


**Long-Term:**


- Monitor for recurrence of reaction (up to 6–12 months)  
- Monthly exams during MDT
