## Master Clinical Case: Histoid Leprosy


### **Part 1: Case Description**


**Patient Profile:**

- Gender: Male  
- Occupation: Tailor  
- Residence: Urban slum in a leprosy-endemic region


**Chief Complaint:** The patient presents with multiple nodular lesions on his back and thighs, present for the past 5 months.


**History of Present Illness:** The patient reports the development of painless, shiny skin nodules over his back and thighs over the last 5 months. These nodules have progressively increased in number and size. No associated itching or ulceration. He also complains of mild numbness over the feet and hands, along with occasional tingling.


He has no known prior diagnosis or treatment for leprosy. This is his first presentation with skin lesions. No recent contact with known leprosy patients.


**Past Medical History:**


- No significant past medical history


**Family History:**


- No history of similar illness in family members


**Social History:**


- Works in close contact with people; lives in crowded housing


**Review of Systems:**


- Skin: Multiple non-itchy nodules  
- Neuro: Numbness, glove-and-stocking paresthesia  
- General: No fever, weight loss, or joint pain

### **Part 2: Primary Symptoms**


1. Multiple dome-shaped, shiny nodules and papules  
2. Typically located over bony prominences (back, thighs, elbows)  
3. Firm, well-defined, painless lesions  
4. Peripheral nerve thickening  
5. Glove-and-stocking paresthesia  
6. Absence of systemic symptoms  
7. Possible nasal stuffiness in advanced cases

### **Part 3: Relevant Background Information**


- Primary case with no prior history of leprosy  
- Poor compliance and incomplete follow-up  
- High community exposure risk  
- Immunocompetent individual (no HIV, diabetes)


---


### **Part 4: Master Physical Examination List**


- Skin exam (shiny, firm nodules) — ⚡️ Mandatory image  
- Sensory testing of limbs and lesions  
- Peripheral nerve palpation (ulnar, peroneal, tibial)  
- Motor function of hands/feet  
- Nasal mucosa examination (if nasal stuffiness)  
- Eye exam (normal unless late complication)


---


### **Part 5: Master Lab Test List**


- Slit-skin smear — ⚡️ Mandatory image  
- Skin biopsy with Fite-Faraco stain — ⚡️ Mandatory image  
- PCR for M. leprae (if drug resistance suspected)  
- CBC, LFT, RFT  
- HIV test  
- Nerve conduction studies (to assess peripheral neuropathy)


---


### **Part 6: History and Findings**


**Key Questions:**


- When did the nodules first appear?  
- Are the nodules increasing in number or size?  
- Any sensory changes or deformities?  
- Any numbness in your hands or feet?  
- Did you complete previous leprosy treatment?  
- Any nasal symptoms or eye complaints?  
- Have you experienced any skin changes such as redness, pain, or swelling in nodules?  
- Are any household contacts showing skin lesions or symptoms?


**Vitals:** Normal


**Findings:**


- Multiple firm, dome-shaped shiny nodules over back and thighs  
- No ulceration or discharge  
- Thickened peripheral nerves  
- Glove-and-stocking sensory loss  
- No systemic signs

### **Part 7: Primary Diagnosis**


**Histoid Leprosy (Multibacillary \- Variant of Lepromatous Type)**


- Shiny, nodular lesions  
- Peripheral nerve thickening and glove-and-stocking sensory loss  
- Positive AFB smear and histopathology with spindle-shaped histiocytes


---


### **Part 8: Differential Diagnoses**


**Correct:**


- Lepromatous Leprosy (without typical nodules)


**Incorrect:**


- Dermatofibroma (solitary, not anesthetic)  
- Neurofibromatosis (soft lesions, family history)  
- Cutaneous sarcoidosis (different histology)


---


### **Part 9: Diagnostic Testing and Interpretation**


- **Slit-skin smear:** Strongly positive AFB (BI 5+ to 6+) — ⚡️ Mandatory image  
- **Skin biopsy:** Spindle-shaped histiocytes, abundant AFB — ⚡️ Mandatory image  
- **PCR:** Confirms diagnosis or detects rifampicin resistance (if suspected)  
- **Nerve conduction:** Reduced amplitude, slowed conduction velocity  
- **CBC, LFT, RFT:** Baseline for MDT safety  
- **HIV test:** Negative


---


### **Part 10: Final Diagnosis**


**Histoid Leprosy (Multibacillary Leprosy \- de novo type)**


- Based on classical shiny nodules, no prior MDT, and smear/biopsy positivity

### **Part 12: Management & Treatment Plan**

Here's the revised **🧪 Pre-Treatment Investigations** table with **diagnostic tests removed** (i.e., *Slit-skin smear*, *Biopsy with Fite stain*, *PCR*), retaining only those relevant to baseline monitoring and treatment safety:

---

#### 🧪 Pre-Treatment Investigations

| Investigation | Purpose | Relevant Drug(s) |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| CBC | Rule out anemia, monitor marrow suppression | Dapsone, Rifampicin |
| LFTs | Liver safety profile | Rifampicin, Clofazimine |
| RFTs | Baseline renal function | Clofazimine |
| HIV Test | Screen for coinfection | All MDT drugs |
| Fasting Blood Glucose | Baseline metabolic status | General |
| Nerve conduction study | Neuropathy documentation | General |

 
#### 🔁 Monitoring During and After Treatment


| Time Point | Investigation | Purpose | Relevant Drug(s) |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Monthly | Clinical exam | Track nodular regression and neuropathy | All |
|  | Sensory/motor testing | Detect silent neuritis | All |
|  | Adherence check | Ensure compliance | All |
| Every 3 Months | CBC, LFTs | Monitor for drug-related toxicity | Dapsone, Rifampicin, Clofazimine |
| If symptomatic | Eye exam | Detect clofazimine pigmentation | Clofazimine |
|  | Methemoglobin level | Suspect dapsone toxicity | Dapsone |
|  | PCR (if relapse/non-response) | Rule out drug resistance | Rifampicin |


**WHO MDT Regimen (Multibacillary, 12 months minimum):**


- **Rifampicin 600 mg** once monthly (supervised)  
- **Clofazimine 300 mg** once monthly (supervised)  
- **Clofazimine 50 mg** daily (self-administered)  
- **Dapsone 100 mg** daily (self-administered)


**Supportive Management:**


- Protective footwear if sensory loss  
- Patient education and monthly counseling  
- Family/contact screening


**Prognosis:**


- Excellent with full compliance  
- Higher relapse risk if previously treated or resistant


**Long-Term:**


- Extended surveillance (up to 5 years post-treatment)  
- Monitor for reactions and deformities
