    "image_prompt": "Rajesh Kumar, a 35-year-old male agricultural worker from a rural area in India, sits in a modest clinical examination room. He has short black hair, a sturdy build, and is wearing a simple white cotton shirt and worn brown trousers typical for farmers. His expression shows a mix of concern and anxiety as he looks down at his red patches on his arms. His hands rest on his knees, slightly trembling. In the background, a padded examination bed with crisp white paper sits next to a wall adorned with medical diagrams relevant to skin conditions. Light filters gently through a window, creating a warm, inviting atmosphere. A couple of farming tools lean against the wall, while a family photo is visible on the desk, hinting at his close family ties. The room feels clinical yet supportive, with subtle hints of his daily life outside the clinic."
