    "image_prompt": "A 45-year-old Indian shopkeeper named Rajesh Kumar, sitting on an examination bed in a clinical room, looking concerned. He has short, dark hair and is wearing a colorful traditional kurta. His arms and legs show subtle signs of painful red nodules, and his expression reflects worry and discomfort. Rajesh is slightly hunched forward, with his hands resting on his knees, occasionally glancing down at the nodules with furrowed brows. The room has a professional yet warm atmosphere, with soft lighting and a medical chart on the wall detailing common skin conditions. In the background, a nurse is preparing supplies with a caring demeanor, contributing to a feeling of support and empathy."
