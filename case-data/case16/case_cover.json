    "image_prompt": "A 26-year-old Indian woman named Neha Verma sitting in a well-lit clinical room with a concerned yet optimistic expression. She\u2019s wearing a smart casual outfit suitable for an office setting, comprising a light blue blouse and dark jeans. Neha has medium-length hair tied back loosely, and she is gently touching her left arm, where she has visible, slightly raised red patches resembling welts, indicative of her discomfort. Her posture is slightly hunched as she leans forward, her brow furrowed in contemplation while glancing down at her arm. The clinical room is equipped with a modern examination bed and a small desk with a laptop and notepad, showcasing a blend of personal and professional life. Sunlight filters through the window, casting a soft glow, creating a warm yet clinical atmosphere that evokes empathy and professionalism. In the background, a nurse is seen organizing supplies, adding a supportive element to the scene."
