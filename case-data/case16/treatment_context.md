### 👩‍⚕️ Patient Summary

A 26-year-old woman presents with urticarial lesions triggered by cold exposure, lasting over 24 hours and resolving with bruising. She reports fatigue, joint stiffness, and two episodes of angioedema. She uses propranolol for anxiety, which could complicate emergency treatment. Autoimmune markers (ANA, low C3/C4) and skin biopsy confirm urticarial vasculitis.

### 🧪 Pre-Treatment Investigations

- **CBC:** Detect eosinophilia or systemic inflammation.  
- **ESR, CRP:** Baseline inflammatory markers.  
- **LFT, RFT:** Assess liver and kidney function before initiating corticosteroids or hydroxychloroquine.  
- **ANA, C3, C4:** Confirm autoimmune activity.  
- **Medication Review:** Identify high-risk drugs such as beta-blockers.  
- **Skin Biopsy:** Diagnostic confirmation of urticarial vasculitis.  
- **Cold Stimulation Test:** Confirm diagnosis of cold-induced urticaria.

### 🔁 Monitoring During Treatment

- **Every 2 weeks:**  
  - **CBC, ESR** – Monitor response to steroid therapy.  
- **Monthly:**  
  - **LFT, RFT** – Monitor drug safety (especially for hydroxychloroquine).  
  - **Skin Diary** – Track flare frequency and severity.  
- **PRN (as needed):**  
  - **Medication Reconciliation** – Check for beta-blocker usage that could impact epinephrine efficacy.  
  - **Skin and Joint Exams** – Identify ongoing inflammation or new flares.  
  - **Emergency Readiness Check** – Reinforce EpiPen use and safety protocols in severe cases.

### 💊 Expected Treatment Plan (With Dosing)

#### ✅ First-Line:
- **Antihistamines**
  - **Cetirizine**: 10 mg PO once daily  
  - **Loratadine**: 10 mg PO once daily  
  - **Fexofenadine**: 180 mg PO once daily  
  Used for controlling pruritus and reducing flare frequency. Preferred due to low sedation and minimal monitoring needs.

---

#### ⚖️ Escalation or Moderate-Severity Management:
- **Low-dose corticosteroids**
  - **Prednisone**: 10–20 mg PO once daily × 5–7 days (taper based on response)  
  Indicated for moderate to severe urticarial vasculitis, particularly when symptoms are persistent or impact quality of life despite antihistamines.

---

#### 💡 Steroid-Sparing or Refractory Cases:
- **Hydroxychloroquine**: 200–400 mg PO once daily  
  Considered for chronic, recurrent, or steroid-dependent cases. Requires baseline and periodic monitoring (e.g., LFTs, ophthalmologic exams). Slow onset — not used for acute symptom control.

---

#### ❌ Contraindicated / To Be Discontinued:
- **Propranolol**: (typically 10–40 mg PO BID)  
  Should be discontinued in patients at risk of anaphylaxis, as it can blunt the effect of emergency epinephrine and mask adrenergic warning signs. Avoid in urticarial vasculitis where epinephrine may be needed.

### 📚 Additional Notes:
- Patient education: Cold avoidance, flare tracking  
- Epinephrine auto-injector: Consider if history of angioedema or risk of anaphylaxis
