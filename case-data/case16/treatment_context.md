### 👩‍⚕️ Patient Summary

A 26-year-old woman presents with urticarial lesions triggered by cold exposure, lasting over 24 hours and resolving with bruising. She reports fatigue, joint stiffness, and two episodes of angioedema. She uses propranolol for anxiety, which could complicate emergency treatment. Autoimmune markers (ANA, low C3/C4) and skin biopsy confirm urticarial vasculitis.

### 🧪 Pre-Treatment Investigations

- **CBC:** Detect eosinophilia or systemic inflammation.  
- **ESR, CRP:** Baseline inflammatory markers.  
- **LFT, RFT:** Assess liver and kidney function before initiating corticosteroids or hydroxychloroquine.  
- **ANA, C3, C4:** Confirm autoimmune activity.  
- **Medication Review:** Identify high-risk drugs such as beta-blockers.  
- **Skin Biopsy:** Diagnostic confirmation of urticarial vasculitis.  
- **Cold Stimulation Test:** Confirm diagnosis of cold-induced urticaria.

### 🔁 Monitoring During Treatment

- **Every 2 weeks:**  
  - **CBC, ESR** – Monitor response to steroid therapy.  
- **Monthly:**  
  - **LFT, RFT** – Monitor drug safety (especially for hydroxychloroquine).  
  - **Skin Diary** – Track flare frequency and severity.  
- **PRN (as needed):**  
  - **Medication Reconciliation** – Check for beta-blocker usage that could impact epinephrine efficacy.  
  - **Skin and Joint Exams** – Identify ongoing inflammation or new flares.  
  - **Emergency Readiness Check** – Reinforce EpiPen use and safety protocols in severe cases.

### 💊 Treatment Plan

- **Antihistamines:** For symptom control (pruritus, flares).  
- **Low-dose Corticosteroids:** Prednisone 10–20 mg/day for moderate to severe cases.  
- **Hydroxychloroquine:** Considered if disease is persistent or steroid-sparing approach needed.  
- **Propranolol Discontinuation:** Recommended due to interaction risk with emergency epinephrine during anaphylaxis.
