Augmented Case Details for Henoch-Schönlein Purpura (HSP) Case Description A 14-year-old boy is brought to the emergency department by his parents with a 2-week history of a rash on his legs, joint pain, and abdominal discomfort. The parents report that the rash has spread and become more intense over the past few days. The patient describes the rash as red spots that later turned purple, especially on the lower parts of his legs. He also complains of intermittent cramp-like abdominal pain and mild joint pain in his knees and ankles. Primary Symptoms - Red and purple spots on the legs that feel slightly raised and are tender to touch. Occasional cramp-like abdominal pain. Aching pain in the knees and ankles without any noticeable swelling. Relevant Background Information - Recent cold-like symptoms one month ago. No history of recent medication, allergies, or chronic illnesses. No significant family history of autoimmune or systemic diseases. Stage 1: Initial Case Presentation and Information Gathering Required Patient History Questions: 1. When did the symptoms start, and how have they progressed? 2. Have there been any recent illnesses or medications? 3. Is there any family history of autoimmune or systemic diseases? Physical Examination Findings: - - Vitals: - Height: 165 cm (50th percentile), Weight: 60 kg (75th percentile). - Temperature: 37.0°C (98.6°F), Pulse: 85/min, Blood Pressure: 110/70 mm Hg. Skin Examination: - Red and purple, slightly raised spots on the lower legs and buttocks, non-blanching and mildly tender. - Abdominal Examination: - Mild tenderness in the lower abdomen with no guarding or rebound tenderness. Musculoskeletal Examination: - Mild tenderness in knees and ankles without swelling, redness, or warmth. - Full range of motion is preserved. Stage 2: Primary Diagnosis and Reasoning Expected Primary Diagnosis: - Henoch-Schönlein Purpura (HSP). Key Reasoning Points: 1. Clinical Features: Non-blanching purpura, mild abdominal pain, and joint tenderness. 2. History of Illness: Recent cold-like symptoms suggest immune activation. 3. Physical Exam Findings: Rash consistent with small-vessel vasculitis. Common Errors to Anticipate: - Overlooking abdominal tenderness as a symptom of HSP. Misinterpreting the rash as a drug-induced reaction without considering the lack of medication use. Stage 3: Differential Diagnoses and Refinement Curated List of Differential Diagnoses: - - Correct: - IgA Vasculitis. - Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE). - Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis with Vasculitis Component. Incorrect: - Drug-Induced Hypersensitivity Vasculitis. - Contact Dermatitis. Descriptions for Differential Diagnoses: 1. IgA Vasculitis (Correct): Fits the acute presentation and purpura. 2. SLE (Correct): Considered due to joint pain but less likely given lack of systemic signs. 3. Drug-Induced Hypersensitivity Vasculitis (Incorrect): Unlikely without medication use. Stage 4: Diagnostic Testing and Interpretation Curated Test Options: - - Correct: - CBC: Mild increase in white blood cells. - ESR: Elevated, indicating inflammation. - Urinalysis: Small amounts of blood and protein. - Skin Biopsy: IgA deposits confirming HSP. Incorrect: - Allergy Testing: Irrelevant in this case. - Liver Function Tests: No evidence of hepatic involvement. Expected Test Results: - CBC and ESR: Mildly elevated ESR and mild increase in white blood cells. Urinalysis: Shows small amounts of blood and protein in the urine. Skin Biopsy: IgA deposits. Optional Additional Tests: - Antinuclear Antibody (ANA): To rule out SLE if systemic signs emerge. Stage 5: Final Diagnosis and Feedback Expected Final Diagnosis: - Henoch-Schönlein Purpura (HSP). Key Supporting Evidence: 1. Non-blanching rash with abdominal pain and joint tenderness. 2. Recent cold-like symptoms, ESR elevation, and IgA deposits on skin biopsy. Feedback Triggers: 1. Correct Diagnosis Feedback: Reinforce that HSP is common in children and presents with red spots, joint pain, and abdominal pain. 2. Incorrect Diagnosis Feedback: Provide rationale for ruling out drug-induced vasculitis or SLE.
