### Augmented Case \- Henoch-Schönlein Purpura (HSP)

---

## Case Description

A 14-year-old boy is brought to the emergency department by his parents with a two-week history of a rash on his legs, joint pain, and abdominal discomfort. The parents report that the rash has spread and become more intense over the past few days. The patient describes the rash as red spots that later turned purple, especially on the lower parts of his legs. He also complains of intermittent cramp-like abdominal pain and mild joint pain in his knees and ankles.

## Primary Symptoms

- Red and purple spots on the legs that feel slightly raised and are tender to touch.  
- Occasional cramp-like abdominal pain.  
- Aching pain in the knees and ankles without any noticeable swelling.

---

## Relevant Background Information

- **Relevant**:  
  - Rash started two weeks ago, spreading and intensifying, particularly on the legs.  
  - Recent cold-like symptoms one month ago.  
  - Abdominal pain and joint tenderness.  
- **Non-Relevant**:  
  - No history of recent medication, allergies, or chronic illnesses.  
  - No significant family history of autoimmune or systemic diseases.

## Stage 1: Initial Case Presentation

### Required Patient History Questions

2. When did the symptoms start, and how have they progressed?  
3. Have there been any recent illnesses or medications?  
4. Is there any family history of autoimmune or systemic diseases?  
5. What triggers or alleviates the abdominal pain?

### Physical Examination Findings

- **Relevant**:  
  - **Skin Examination**:  
    - Red and purple, slightly raised spots on the lower legs and buttocks, non-blanching and mildly tender.  
  - **Abdominal Examination**:  
    - Mild tenderness in the lower abdomen with no guarding or rebound tenderness.  
  - **Musculoskeletal Examination**:  
    - Mild tenderness in knees and ankles without swelling, redness, or warmth. Full range of motion preserved.  
  - **Vitals Check**:  
    - Height: 165 cm, Weight: 60 kg, BMI: 22.0 (Normal).  
    - Temperature: 37.0°C (98.6°F), Pulse: 85/min, Blood Pressure: 110/70 mm Hg.  
- **Irrelevant**:  
  - Respiratory Examination: Normal breath sounds.  
  - Neurological Examination: No abnormalities detected.

## Stage 2: Primary Diagnosis and Reasoning

### Expected Primary Diagnosis

- Henoch-Schönlein Purpura (HSP).

### Key Reasoning Points

1. **Clinical Features**: Non-blanching purpura, mild abdominal pain, and joint tenderness.  
2. **History of Illness**: Recent cold-like symptoms suggest immune activation.  
3. **Physical Exam Findings**: Rash consistent with small-vessel vasculitis.

### Common Errors to Anticipate

- Overlooking abdominal tenderness as a symptom of HSP.  
- Misinterpreting the rash as a drug-induced reaction without considering the lack of medication use.

## Stage 3: Differential Diagnoses

### Correct

1. IgA Vasculitis  
2. Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE)  
3. Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis with Vasculitis Component

### Incorrect

1. Drug-Induced Hypersensitivity Vasculitis  
2. Contact Dermatitis

### Descriptions for Differential Diagnoses

1. **IgA Vasculitis (Correct)**: Fits the acute presentation and purpura.  
2. **SLE (Correct)**: Considered due to joint pain but less likely given lack of systemic signs.  
3. **Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis with Vasculitis Component (Correct)**: Plausible but less acute presentation.  
4. **Drug-Induced Hypersensitivity Vasculitis (Incorrect)**: Unlikely without medication use.  
5. **Contact Dermatitis (Incorrect)**: Rash morphology and systemic signs inconsistent.

## Stage 4: Diagnostic Testing and Interpretation

### Curated Test Options

- **Correct**:  
  1. Complete Blood Count (CBC) and ESR: Detects inflammation.  
  2. Urinalysis: Detects microscopic hematuria and proteinuria.  
  3. Skin Biopsy: Reveals IgA deposits.  
  4. Antinuclear Antibody (ANA) Test: Optional to rule out SLE in differential diagnosis.  
- **Incorrect**:  
  1. Allergy Panel Testing: Irrelevant given no new exposures.  
  2. Imaging (e.g., X-ray, CT scan): Not relevant for this case.

### Expected Test Results

2. **CBC and ESR**: Mildly elevated ESR and mild increase in white blood cells.  
3. **Urinalysis**: Shows small amounts of blood and protein in the urine.  
4. **Skin Biopsy**: IgA deposits.

### Optional Additional Tests

- **Antinuclear Antibody (ANA)**: To rule out SLE if systemic signs emerge.

## Stage 5: Final Diagnosis and Feedback

### Expected Final Diagnosis

- Henoch-Schönlein Purpura (HSP).

### Key Supporting Evidence

1. Non-blanching rash with abdominal pain and joint tenderness.  
2. Recent cold-like symptoms, ESR elevation, and IgA deposits on skin biopsy.

### Feedback Suggestions

#### Correct Diagnosis Feedback

1. **Highlight the Key Clinical Features**:  
   - "You identified the hallmark features of HSP: purpura, joint pain, and abdominal discomfort following an immune trigger."  
2. **Reinforce Pathophysiology**:  
   - "HSP involves IgA deposition in small vessels, causing inflammation and characteristic symptoms."  
3. **Encourage Diagnostic Confidence**:  
   - "Your reasoning demonstrated strong diagnostic skills by linking clinical findings to small-vessel vasculitis."

#### Incorrect Diagnosis Feedback

1. **Address Misinterpretation**:  
   - "Drug-induced hypersensitivity is unlikely given the lack of recent medication use."  
2. **Refocus on Clinical Clues**:  
   - "Consider purpura with abdominal pain as a strong indicator of IgA vasculitis."  
3. **Provide Corrective Learning Resources**:  
   - "Review vasculitic syndromes in children and their diagnostic pathways."
