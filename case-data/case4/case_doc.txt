# **Bullous Pemphigoid: Medical Case Document**

## **Part 1: Case Description**  
A **75-year-old male** presents to the outpatient dermatology clinic with a **two-month history** of intensely **pruritic rash** and tense blisters primarily on the **trunk and extremities**. He describes the blisters as **large, fluid-filled**, and arising on **erythematous skin**. Some of the blisters have ruptured, leaving behind **crusted erosions**. The patient also reports generalized **itchiness** and difficulty sleeping due to the discomfort. He denies mucosal involvement such as mouth ulcers, hoarseness, or visual changes.

He has a history of **hypertension**, which is controlled with amlodipine, and mild **cognitive decline** (early dementia). No recent medication changes or significant infections have occurred prior to the rash.  

The patient mentions that the symptoms began gradually with itchy, urticarial-like patches before progressing to blister formation.  

### **Risk Factors Notable**:  
- **Age** >70 years.  
- History of neurological comorbidity (early dementia).  
- No known autoimmune history but at risk due to age and associated systemic disease.

## **Part 2: Primary Symptoms**  
1. **Intensely pruritic rash** (itchy, urticarial-like patches preceding blister formation).  
2. **Tense, fluid-filled blisters** on an erythematous base.  
3. **Crusted erosions** in areas where blisters have ruptured.  
4. Generalized **itchiness**, disrupting sleep and daily activities.  
5. **Gradual progression** of symptoms over two months.

## **Part 3: Relevant Background Information**  

### **Relevant Information**:  
1. **Age**: 75 years old (significant risk factor for bullous pemphigoid).  
2. **Neurological Comorbidity**: Early cognitive decline/dementia, which is associated with bullous pemphigoid.  
3. **Gradual Onset**: Symptoms developed over two months, starting with pruritic, urticarial-like patches progressing to blistering.  
4. **Hypertension**: Controlled with amlodipine.  
5. **No Recent Medication Changes or Infections**: Important to rule out drug-induced or infectious triggers.  

### **Non-Relevant Information**:  
- No mucosal involvement (oral, ocular, or genital symptoms absent).  
- No history of autoimmune diseases.  
- No history of recent trauma, burns, or radiotherapy.

## **Part 4: Master List of Physical Examinations**  

### **Relevant Examinations**:  
1. **Skin Examination**: Tense bullae, crusted erosions, and erythematous base.  
2. **Nikolsky Sign**: Negative (blisters do not extend with pressure).  
3. **Bullae Morphology**: Assess size, base, and distribution.  
4. **Mucosal Examination**: Confirm absence of oral, ocular, or genital lesions.  
5. **Neurological Examination**: Assess cognitive decline and neurological comorbidities.  
6. **Vitals**: Blood pressure, temperature, pulse.  
7. **Extremity Examination**: Check for erythema and swelling.  
8. **Abdominal Examination**: Rule out tenderness or organomegaly.  
9. **Joint Examination**: Check for swelling/pain to rule out arthritis.  
10. **Respiratory Examination**: Assess for any difficulty breathing.  

### **Irrelevant Examinations**:  
- Fundoscopic eye exam.  
- Hearing assessment.  
- Lymph node examination.  
- Cardiovascular auscultation.  
- Otolaryngological exam.

## **Part 5: Master List of Lab Tests**  

### **Relevant Tests**:  
1. **Direct Immunofluorescence (DIF)**  
2. **Indirect Immunofluorescence (IIF)** with salt-split skin.  
3. **ELISA for BP180 and BP230 Antibodies**.  
4. **Skin Biopsy for Histopathology**.  
5. **Complete Blood Count (CBC)**.  
6. **Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate (ESR) / C-Reactive Protein (CRP)**.  
7. **Basic Metabolic Panel (BMP)**.  
8. **Serum Immunoglobulin E (IgE)**.  

### **Irrelevant Tests**:  
- Allergy panels.  
- Rheumatoid Factor (RF).  
- ANA, Anti-dsDNA antibodies.  
- Paraneoplastic antibody panel.

## **Part 6: Initial Case Presentation and Information Gathering**  

### **Patient History Questions**:  
1. When did the rash and blisters first appear, and how have they progressed over time?  
2. Did you experience intense itching or skin changes prior to blister formation?  
3. Have you noticed blisters in your mouth, eyes, nose, or genital areas?  
4. Do you have any history of neurological conditions (e.g., dementia, Parkinson's, or stroke)?  

### **Physical Examination Findings**  

**Vitals**:  
- BP: 140/88 mmHg, Temp: 37.1°C, HR: 84 bpm, RR: 18/min.  

**Skin Examination**:  
- Tense bullae, crusted erosions, symmetrical on trunk/extremities.  
- Negative Nikolsky sign.  

**Mucosal Examination**:  
- No mucosal lesions observed.  

**Systemic Examination**:  
- Neurological: Mild cognitive decline.  
- Normal cardiovascular, respiratory, musculoskeletal, and abdominal findings.

## **Part 7: Primary Diagnosis and Reasoning**  

**Primary Diagnosis**: **Bullous Pemphigoid (BP)**  

### **Reasoning**:  
1. Tense, fluid-filled bullae on erythematous base.  
2. Severe pruritus and gradual onset.  
3. Negative Nikolsky sign.  
4. Age >70 and neurological comorbidity.  

### **Common Errors**:  
- Misdiagnosis as pemphigus vulgaris (flaccid bullae, positive Nikolsky sign).  
- Assuming drug-induced blistering.  
- Confusing with urticaria.

## **Part 8: Differential Diagnoses**  

### **Correct Options**:  
1. **Bullous Pemphigoid**  
2. **Pemphigus Vulgaris**  
3. **Linear IgA Bullous Dermatosis**  
4. **Epidermolysis Bullosa Acquisita**  

### **Incorrect Options**:  
1. Urticaria  
2. Drug-Induced Bullous Eruption  
3. Dermatitis Herpetiformis  
4. Contact Dermatitis  
5. Bullous Impetigo

## **Part 9: Diagnostic Testing and Interpretation**  

### **Essential Tests**:  
- DIF: IgG and C3 along BMZ.  
- IIF: Epidermal binding on salt-split skin.  
- ELISA: Elevated BP180/BP230 autoantibodies.  
- Skin Biopsy: Subepidermal blisters with eosinophilic infiltrate.  

### **Optional Tests**:  
- Salt-split skin immunoblotting.

### **Feedback**:  
- **Key Features**: Tense bullae, intense pruritus, negative Nikolsky sign.  
- **Pathophysiology**: IgG autoantibodies targeting BP180/BP230.
