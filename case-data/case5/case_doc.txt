# **Medical Case: Pemphigus Vulgaris**

## **Part 1: Case Description**

A 45-year-old man presents with a **2-month history** of painful oral ulcers and progressively worsening **blistering skin lesions**. He describes the oral ulcers as persistent, interfering with eating and speaking. The skin lesions began as **flaccid blisters** on his trunk and upper arms, which easily rupture, leaving behind raw, eroded skin. The lesions are non-itchy but extremely painful. The patient denies any recent illnesses, new medications, or significant environmental exposures.

### **Risk Factors:**

- Middle-aged adult (40–60 years old).  
- Positive family history of autoimmune diseases (mother had **rheumatoid arthritis**).  
- No prior skin conditions or other systemic illnesses.

## **Part 2: Primary Symptoms**

1. **Painful oral ulcers** – Persistent, interfere with eating and speaking.  
2. **Flaccid skin blisters** – Begin on the trunk and upper arms; rupture easily, leaving raw, eroded skin.  
3. **Severe pain** in areas of ruptured blisters.  
4. **Non-itchy lesions** – No associated pruritus.  
5. **Progressive spread** of skin lesions over the past two months.

- **Oral Involvement**: Painful ulcers in the oral cavity (early and persistent symptom).  
- **Skin Lesions**: Flaccid blisters that rupture easily, leaving raw, eroded areas.  
- **Autoimmune Predisposition**: Family history of autoimmune disease (mother with rheumatoid arthritis).  
- **Age**: Middle-aged adult (45 years old).

### **Non-Relevant Factors:**

- No history of recent illness or infection.  
- No exposure to new medications or environmental triggers.  
- No history of pruritic skin conditions or chronic dermatologic diseases.

## **Part 6: Initial Case Presentation and Information Gathering**

### **Required Patient History Questions**

1. When did you first notice the oral ulcers, and how have they progressed over time?  
2. Have the skin blisters been painful or itchy? Do they rupture easily?  
3. Have you experienced any similar symptoms in the past, or is this the first episode?  
4. Is there a family history of autoimmune diseases or skin disorders?

### **Physical Examination Findings**

**Vitals:**

- Height: 175 cm  
- Weight: 78 kg  
- BMI: 25.5 (Normal)  
- Temperature: 37.5°C (99.5°F)  
- Heart Rate: 84 bpm  
- Blood Pressure: 128/80 mmHg

**Relevant Findings:**

- **Oral Mucosa Examination**: Presence of multiple erosions on the buccal mucosa and palate; ulcers are painful, shallow, and erythematous.  
- **Skin Examination**:  
  - Flaccid, easily ruptured blisters on the trunk, upper arms, and scalp.  
  - Raw, denuded areas with some crusting and surrounding erythema.  
  - Nikolsky sign **positive** (gentle pressure causes blistering of skin).

**Irrelevant Findings:**

- **Neurological Examination**: Normal findings.  
- **Respiratory Examination**: Normal breath sounds; no wheezing or crackles.  
- **Abdominal Examination**: Soft, non-tender, no organomegaly.

## **Part 7: Primary Diagnosis and Reasoning**

**Expected Primary Diagnosis:**  
**Pemphigus Vulgaris (PV)**

### **Key Reasoning Points:**

1. **Clinical Features**:  
     
   - Painful oral ulcers as the initial symptom.  
   - Flaccid, easily ruptured skin blisters leading to raw, eroded areas.  
   - Positive **Nikolsky sign**, a hallmark feature of pemphigus vulgaris.

   

2. **Histological Evidence**:  
     
   - Suprabasal acantholysis (loss of cell-to-cell adhesion) confirmed through skin biopsy.

   

3. **Autoimmune Markers**:  
     
   - Presence of **anti-desmoglein 3 antibodies** (mucosal involvement).  
   - Possible **anti-desmoglein 1 antibodies** (if cutaneous lesions are present).

   

4. **Family History**:  
     
   - Family history of autoimmune diseases (mother with rheumatoid arthritis), which increases susceptibility.

### **Common Errors to Anticipate:**

- Misdiagnosing as **bullous pemphigoid** (characterized by tense blisters instead of flaccid blisters).  
- Confusing the case with **herpetic stomatitis** or aphthous ulcers due to oral involvement.  
- Overlooking the **positive Nikolsky sign** as a critical diagnostic clue.

## **Part 8: Differential Diagnoses and Refinement**

### **Correct Options (with Explanations):**

1. **Pemphigus Vulgaris (PV)**  
   - Key Features: Painful oral ulcers, flaccid skin blisters that rupture easily, positive Nikolsky sign, and histological evidence of suprabasal acantholysis.  
2. **Bullous Pemphigoid**  
   - Rationale: Similar presentation of blistering skin lesions, but lesions are **tense** rather than flaccid.  
3. **Paraneoplastic Pemphigus**  
   - Rationale: Associated with malignancies; oral erosions and flaccid blisters mimic PV.

### **Incorrect Options (with Explanations):**

1. **Herpetic Gingivostomatitis**: Negative Nikolsky sign, clustered vesicular lesions, often with fever.  
2. **Aphthous Stomatitis**: No skin involvement and lacks Nikolsky sign.  
3. **Stevens-Johnson Syndrome (SJS)**: Drug-related, systemic involvement, with mucosal and skin necrosis.

## **Part 9: Diagnostic Testing and Interpretation**

### **Most Relevant Lab Tests and Expected Results:**

1. **Anti-Desmoglein 1 and 3 Antibody Tests (ELISA): Positive** for anti-DSG3 antibodies.  
2. **Direct Immunofluorescence (DIF):** IgG deposition in a **"chicken-wire" pattern**.  
3. **Skin Biopsy for Histopathology:** Suprabasal acantholysis and "tombstone" basal cells.  
4. **Indirect Immunofluorescence (IIF):** Positive cell surface IgG staining.

### **Irrelevant Lab Tests (to Contrast):**

1. Allergy Panel Testing  
2. Viral Serology  
3. Complement Levels

## **Part 10: Final Diagnosis and Feedback**

**Final Diagnosis:**  
**Pemphigus Vulgaris (PV)**

**Key Supporting Evidence:**

1. Clinical features of oral ulcers and flaccid blisters.  
2. Positive **DIF** and **anti-desmoglein antibodies**.  
3. Skin biopsy confirming suprabasal acantholysis.
