# Medical Case Document: Measles (Rubeola)

## Part 1: Case Description

A 5-year-old child is brought to the clinic with a four-day history of high fever, runny nose, and red, watery eyes. The parent reports a dry, persistent cough that began simultaneously with the fever. Two days ago, they noticed small white spots on the inside of the child's mouth, described as “grains of salt on a red background.” Yesterday, a red, blotchy rash began on the child’s face and has since spread to the trunk and limbs. The child has no significant past medical history, is not vaccinated, and recently attended a birthday party where several other children were unwell.

## Part 2: Primary Symptoms

- High fever (up to 40°C/104°F).  
- Dry, persistent cough.  
- Coryza (runny nose).  
- Conjunctivitis (red, watery eyes).  
- Koplik spots on the buccal mucosa (white spots with a red background).  
- Erythematous, maculopapular rash starting on the face and spreading to the trunk and limbs.

## Part 3: Relevant Background Information

### Relevant:

- Exposure to unwell children at a recent social gathering (potential index case).  
- Lack of prior measles vaccination.  
- Symptoms started four days ago, progressing in a classic pattern (fever, cough, conjunctivitis, Koplik spots, and rash).  
- Rash onset follows the cephalocaudal progression typical of measles.

### Non-Relevant:

- No recent travel to high-risk regions.  
- No reported use of new medications or recent dietary changes.  
- No significant past medical history or chronic illnesses.

## Part 4: Master List of Physical Examinations

1. General Appearance: Assess for ill appearance or lethargy.  
2. Skin: Inspect for the characteristic erythematous maculopapular rash starting on the face and spreading cephalocaudally.  
3. Mouth: Check for Koplik spots on the buccal mucosa.  
4. Eyes: Evaluate for conjunctivitis and photophobia.  
5. Throat: Look for pharyngeal erythema or signs of secondary infection.  
6. Respiratory: Auscultate for signs of secondary complications like pneumonia.  
7. Lymph Nodes: Palpate for lymphadenopathy.  
8. Abdomen: Assess for hepatomegaly or splenomegaly, particularly in cases with systemic complications.  
9. Neurological: Perform a brief exam to rule out encephalitis (assess mental status and reflexes).  
10. Vitals: Document temperature, respiratory rate, pulse, and blood pressure for signs of fever and systemic involvement.

## Part 5: Master List of Lab Tests

1. Measles-specific IgM antibody test (serology).  
2. Measles-specific IgG paired acute and convalescent titers.  
3. Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for measles RNA in blood, nasopharyngeal, or urine samples.  
4. Complete blood count (CBC) to check for leukopenia or lymphopenia.  
5. Liver function tests (LFTs) to assess systemic involvement.  
6. Chest X-ray if respiratory complications like pneumonia are suspected.  
7. C-reactive protein (CRP) and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) for signs of inflammation.  
8. Urinalysis for secondary infections or other complications.  
9. Bacterial culture if secondary infections (e.g., otitis media, pneumonia) are suspected.  
10. Lumbar puncture if symptoms of encephalitis are present.

## Part 6: Initial Case Presentation and Information Gathering

### Required Patient History Questions:

1. When did the symptoms (fever, cough, runny nose) first appear, and how have they progressed?  
2. Has the child been exposed to anyone with similar symptoms, particularly fever and a rash?  
3. Have you noticed any changes in the rash (e.g., spread, changes in color)?  
4. Has the child received any measles vaccinations or other routine immunizations?

### Physical Examination Findings:

**Vitals:**

- Temperature: 40°C (104°F).  
- Pulse: 110/min (tachycardic).  
- Respiratory Rate: 22/min.  
- Blood Pressure: 100/60 mmHg.

**Relevant:**

- Skin: Erythematous maculopapular rash starting on the face and spreading to the trunk and limbs.  
- Mouth: Koplik spots on the buccal mucosa.  
- Eyes: Red, watery eyes with mild photophobia (conjunctivitis).  
- Respiratory: Mild crackles heard in the lower lung fields, suggesting potential secondary pneumonia.

**Irrelevant:**

- Abdomen: No organomegaly noted.  
- Neurological: No signs of altered mental status or focal neurological deficits.  
- Extremities: No rash or petechiae on the palms or soles.

## Part 7: Primary Diagnosis and Reasoning

### Expected Primary Diagnosis:

- **Measles (Rubeola)**

### Key Reasoning Points:

1. **Classic Symptoms**: The patient presents with a high fever, cough, conjunctivitis, and characteristic erythematous maculopapular rash, which spread in a typical cephalocaudal manner.  
2. **Koplik Spots**: The presence of Koplik spots, which are pathognomonic for measles, strengthens the diagnosis.  
3. **Exposure History**: The child had recent exposure to other potentially infected individuals at a social gathering, which is consistent with measles' high contagiousness.  
4. **Vaccination History**: The patient is unvaccinated, a key risk factor for acquiring measles.  
5. **Laboratory Tests**: A positive IgM antibody test for measles, along with a rise in IgG antibodies, would confirm the diagnosis. RT-PCR may also be used for viral detection.

### Common Errors to Anticipate:

- **Misdiagnosing as another viral exanthem**: The rash could be mistaken for rubella, varicella, or even drug rashes. However, the characteristic pattern of rash and the presence of Koplik spots are specific to measles.  
- **Attributing symptoms to a more common respiratory infection**: Symptoms like fever, cough, and coryza are common in many viral infections, but the combination with a spreading rash and Koplik spots points to measles.  
- **Failure to consider exposure history**: In areas with low measles prevalence, clinicians may forget to ask about exposure to unvaccinated individuals or recent gatherings.

## Part 8: Differential Diagnoses and Refinement

### Correct Differential Diagnoses:

1. **Measles (Primary Diagnosis)**  
     
   - **Explanation**: The hallmark features of fever, coryza, conjunctivitis, Koplik spots, and a cephalocaudally spreading maculopapular rash make this the most likely diagnosis.

   

2. **Rubella**  
     
   - **Why it fits**: Both measles and rubella present with a maculopapular rash and fever.  
   - **Why it doesn’t fit**: Rubella rash is typically milder, spreads faster, and does not involve conjunctivitis or Koplik spots.

   

3. **Roseola (Exanthem Subitum)**  
     
   - **Why it fits**: High fever followed by a maculopapular rash is a hallmark of roseola.  
   - **Why it doesn’t fit**: The rash in roseola appears after the fever resolves and does not follow the cephalocaudal progression seen in measles.

   

4. **Scarlet Fever**  
     
   - **Why it fits**: Fever and rash may mimic measles, especially in younger children.  
   - **Why it doesn’t fit**: The rash in scarlet fever is fine and sandpaper-like, and there are no Koplik spots or conjunctivitis.

### Incorrect Differential Diagnoses:

1. **Drug Reaction**  
     
   - **Why it doesn’t fit**: Drug eruptions lack systemic symptoms like conjunctivitis and coryza and are often pruritic.

   

2. **Hand-Foot-and-Mouth Disease**  
     
   - **Why it doesn’t fit**: This presents with vesicular lesions on the hands, feet, and inside the mouth, rather than a widespread maculopapular rash.

   

3. **Kawasaki Disease**  
     
   - **Why it doesn’t fit**: While Kawasaki disease includes fever and mucocutaneous involvement, it lacks the characteristic rash and Koplik spots of measles.

## Part 9: Diagnostic Testing and Interpretation

### Most Relevant Tests and Expected Results:

1. **Measles-Specific IgM Antibody Test**  
     
   - **Expected Result**: Positive within 3 days of rash onset, confirming acute measles infection.

   

2. **Measles-Specific IgG (Paired Acute and Convalescent Titers)**  
     
   - **Expected Result**: A fourfold rise in IgG titer between acute and convalescent samples confirms infection.

   

3. **Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR)**  
     
   - **Expected Result**: Detection of measles RNA in blood, nasopharyngeal, or urine samples confirms diagnosis.

   

4. **Complete Blood Count (CBC)**  
     
   - **Expected Result**: Leukopenia and lymphopenia, common in measles infection.

   

5. **Chest X-Ray**  
     
   - **Expected Result**: May show patchy infiltrates if secondary bacterial pneumonia is present.

### Irrelevant or Less Relevant Tests:

1. **Allergy Panel**  
     
   - **Why irrelevant**: Measles symptoms are not allergenic in nature.

   

2. **Monospot Test (for Infectious Mononucleosis)**  
     
   - **Why irrelevant**: Lacks the characteristic rash progression and systemic symptoms of measles.

   

3. **Throat Swab for Bacterial Culture**  
     
   - **Why irrelevant**: Not indicated unless there is clinical suspicion of bacterial pharyngitis.

### Optional Additional Tests:

1. **Vitamin A Levels**  
     
   - **Rationale**: Vitamin A deficiency can worsen measles outcomes. Supplementation may be indicated in deficient children.

   

2. **Lumbar Puncture**  
     
   - **Rationale**: Only indicated if symptoms of encephalitis or altered mental status are present.

## Part 10: Final Diagnosis and Feedback

### Final Diagnosis:

- **Measles (Rubeola)**

### Key Supporting Evidence:

1. **Clinical Features**:  
     
   - Fever, cough, coryza, and conjunctivitis (the "three Cs") preceding the characteristic rash.  
   - Koplik spots on the buccal mucosa, which are pathognomonic for measles.  
   - Rash with cephalocaudal progression, consistent with measles.

   

2. **Laboratory Confirmation**:  
     
   - Positive IgM serology for measles.  
   - Rise in measles-specific IgG titers in paired samples or RT-PCR detection of measles RNA.

   

3. **History and Risk Factors**:  
     
   - Exposure to unvaccinated individuals in a high-risk setting (social gathering).  
   - Lack of vaccination increases susceptibility to measles.

### Feedback for Correct Diagnosis:

- **Strengths**:  
    
  - Excellent identification of hallmark symptoms and consideration of vaccination history and exposure.  
  - Proper use of diagnostic tools like IgM serology and RT-PCR for confirmation.


- **Encouragement**:  
    
  - "You accurately linked the clinical presentation to the disease’s pathophysiology and recognized the importance of history-taking in identifying exposure and vaccination status."

### Feedback for Incorrect Diagnoses:

1. **Rubella**:  
     
   - "The milder rash and absence of conjunctivitis or Koplik spots help differentiate rubella from measles."

   

2. **Scarlet Fever**:  
     
   - "The fine, sandpaper-like rash of scarlet fever contrasts with the maculopapular rash of measles, and there are no Koplik spots in scarlet fever."

   

3. **Drug Eruption**:  
     
   - "Lack of systemic symptoms such as fever, cough, or conjunctivitis, and a history of recent drug exposure, would be key indicators of a drug reaction."
