Augmented - Calciphylaxis Case Description A 65-year-old woman with a history of chronic kidney disease (CKD) presents to the dermatology clinic with painful, non-healing ulcers on her lower legs. She reports that the lesions started as small, red-purple patches and gradually expanded, becoming extremely painful and ulcerated. The pain is described as severe, sharp, and constant, requiring regular analgesics. The patient has been on dialysis three times a week for the past two years. Primary Symptoms - Painful red-purple patches on the lower legs progressing to non-healing ulcers. Severe, constant pain in the affected areas. History of chronic kidney disease with regular dialysis. Relevant Background Information - Recent CKD diagnosis requiring regular dialysis. Secondary hyperparathyroidism intermittently treated. No significant dietary changes or additional health events. Master List of Physical Examinations 1. 2. 3. 4. 5. 6. 7. 8.

Imaging (e.g., X-rays for calcifications) 8. Complete Blood Count (CBC) 9. Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate (ESR) 10. Urinalysis Stage 1: Initial Case Presentation and Information Gathering Required Patient History Questions: 1. 2. 3. 4. When did the skin lesions start, and how have they progressed? Have you experienced any recent changes in your health, medications, or test results? Are you currently taking any medications for your kidney condition? Have you had any injuries, infections, or surgeries in the past few months? Physical Examination Findings: - Vitals: - - Skin Examination: - - Height: 160 cm, Weight: 70 kg, BMI: 27.3 (Overweight). Temperature: 36.9°C (98.4°F), Pulse: 82/min, Blood Pressure: 135/85 mm Hg. Violaceous (purple-red) retiform patches with ulceration and black eschar. Surrounding induration and tenderness. Systemic Examination: - No signs of systemic inflammation (e.g., fever, lymphadenopathy). Relevant Physical Examinations: 1. Skin Examination. 2. Vitals Check. 3. Systemic Examination. Irrelevant Physical Examinations: 1. Respiratory Examination. 2. Neurological Examination. 3. Oral Examination. Stage 2: Primary Diagnosis and Reasoning Expected Primary Diagnosis: - Calciphylaxis (Calcific Uremic Arteriolopathy). Key Reasoning Points: 1. Clinical Features: Necrotic, painful ulcers with a retiform pattern. 2. Risk Factors: Chronic kidney disease and secondary hyperparathyroidism. 3. Lab/History Correlation: Likely elevated calcium-phosphate product with ischemic vascular damage. Common Errors to Anticipate: - Misdiagnosing ulcers as venous stasis or diabetic foot ulcers. Overlooking severe pain and CKD history as distinguishing features. Stage 3: Differential Diagnoses and Refinement Curated List of Differential Diagnoses: - - Correct: 1. Calciphylaxis. 2. Vasculitis with CKD. 3. Embolic Disease. Incorrect: 1. Venous Stasis Ulcers. 2. Diabetic Foot Ulcers. Descriptions for Differential Diagnoses: 2. Calciphylaxis (Correct): Fits the clinical presentation, CKD history, and necrotic lesions. 3. Vasculitis with CKD (Correct): Considered in systemic presentations but less likely without systemic signs. 4. Embolic Disease (Correct): May mimic calciphylaxis if vascular occlusion is involved. 5. Venous Stasis Ulcers (Incorrect): Typically painless, without retiform patterns. 6. Diabetic Foot Ulcers (Incorrect): Unlikely without diabetes or peripheral neuropathy. Stage 4: Diagnostic Testing and Interpretation Relevant Lab Tests: 1. Serum Calcium/Phosphate Levels. 2. Parathyroid Hormone (PTH). 3. Skin Biopsy with Special Stains (e.g., von Kossa, Alizarin Red). Irrelevant Lab Tests: 1. Allergy Testing. 2. Liver Function Tests. 3. Blood Culture. Expected Test Results: - Serum Calcium/Phosphate Levels: Elevated. PTH: Elevated. Skin Biopsy: Ischemic vascular damage and calcium deposits. Optional Additional Tests: - Imaging: X-rays may show subcutaneous calcifications in advanced cases. Stage 5: Final Diagnosis and Feedback Expected Final Diagnosis: - Calciphylaxis. Key Supporting Evidence: 1. Painful, necrotic retiform ulcers in a CKD patient. 2. Elevated calcium-phosphate product and PTH levels. 3. Biopsy findings showing ischemic changes and vascular calcifications. Correct Diagnosis Feedback: 1. Highlight Key Clinical Features: - "You correctly identified calciphylaxis based on the severe pain, CKD history, and necrotic ulcers with a retiform pattern." 2. Reinforce Pathophysiology: - "Calciphylaxis is caused by small and medium vessel calcification leading to vascular occlusion and ischemia." 3. Encourage Diagnostic Confidence: - "Your reasoning demonstrated a clear understanding of the clinical presentation and risk factors." Incorrect Diagnosis Feedback: 1. Address Misinterpretations: - "Venous stasis or diabetic ulcers are typically painless and lack the CKD connection seen here." 2. Refocus on Key Risk Factors: - "This patient's CKD and dialysis history are significant risk factors that should guide the diagnosis." Suggested Resources 1.
