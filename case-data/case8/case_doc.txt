# Medical Case: Typhoid Fever

---

## **Part 1: Case Description**

A 28-year-old male presents to the emergency department with a 7-day history of persistent high-grade fever, fatigue, and abdominal pain. He reports episodes of nausea and loose stools. The patient has a decreased appetite and notes recent travel to a rural area in South Asia. On further questioning, he describes a progressive worsening of symptoms, including a dull, aching abdominal pain predominantly in the right lower quadrant. He denies any prior history of similar episodes but recalls consuming untreated water during his travels.

Risk factors include recent travel to an endemic region, consumption of potentially contaminated food and water, and lack of typhoid vaccination.

## **Part 3: Relevant Background Information**

### **Relevant Factors:**

- History of consuming untreated water during travel.  
- No record of typhoid vaccination.

### **Non-Relevant Factors:**

- No significant medical history or chronic illnesses.  
- No recent use of antibiotics prior to this episode.  
- No exposure to individuals with similar symptoms.

## **Part 6: Initial Case Presentation and Information Gathering**

### **Required Patient History Questions:**

1. When did your symptoms, including fever and abdominal pain, begin?  
2. Have you recently traveled to areas where typhoid is common?  
3. Did you consume untreated water or food from unknown sources during your travel?  
4. Have you noticed any changes in your stool, such as frequency, consistency, or blood?

### **Physical Examination Findings:**

**Vitals:**

- Temperature: 39.5°C (103.1°F).  
- Blood Pressure: 110/70 mmHg.  
- Heart Rate: 96 bpm.  
- Respiratory Rate: 18 breaths/min.

**Relevant Findings:**

- Abdominal tenderness, particularly in the right lower quadrant.  
- Hepatomegaly and mild splenomegaly on palpation.  
- Faint rose spots on the trunk.  
- Mild dehydration (dry mucous membranes, reduced skin turgor).

**Irrelevant Findings:**

- Neurological examination normal.  
- No lymphadenopathy noted.  
- Cardiovascular and respiratory examinations unremarkable.

## **Part 7: Primary Diagnosis and Reasoning**

### **Expected Primary Diagnosis:**

- Typhoid Fever (*Salmonella Typhi* infection).

### **Key Reasoning Points:**

1. **Clinical Features:** Persistent fever, fatigue, abdominal pain, and rose spots align with typhoid fever.  
2. **Travel History:** Recent travel to a typhoid-endemic region with exposure to untreated water.  
3. **Physical Findings:** Hepatomegaly, mild splenomegaly, and rose spots are hallmark features.  
4. **Lab Correlations:** Blood culture confirming *Salmonella Typhi* infection.

### **Common Errors to Anticipate:**

- Misdiagnosing as malaria without confirming with a peripheral smear.  
- Overlooking travel history and exposure to untreated water.  
- Overreliance on the Widal test without considering its limitations.

---

## **Part 8: Differential Diagnoses and Refinement**

### **Correct Options (including Primary Diagnosis):**

1. **Typhoid Fever:** Persistent fever, rose spots, and systemic symptoms.  
2. **Malaria:** Common in endemic regions but ruled out by negative peripheral smear.  
3. **Amebic Liver Abscess:** Fever and abdominal pain but no rose spots or systemic findings.  
4. **Dengue Fever:** Fever with fatigue and rash but lacks rose spots or hepatosplenomegaly.

### **Incorrect Options:**

1. **Acute Appendicitis:** Abdominal pain without systemic features or prolonged fever.  
2. **Viral Gastroenteritis:** Lacks systemic symptoms and prolonged febrile course.  
3. **Sepsis from Other Causes:** Systemic symptoms may overlap, but blood culture reveals the specific pathogen.

---

## **Part 9: Diagnostic Testing and Interpretation**

### **Most Relevant Lab Tests and Expected Results:**

1. **Blood Culture:** Positive for *Salmonella Typhi*.  
2. **Complete Blood Count (CBC):** Leukopenia, anemia, mild thrombocytopenia.  
3. **Widal Test:** Rising antibody titers to *S. Typhi* antigens (limited reliability).  
4. **Stool Culture:** Positive in the early stages.  
5. **Peripheral Smear:** Negative for malarial parasites.

### **Irrelevant Tests for Contrast:**

- Allergy Panel Testing.  
- Imaging (e.g., abdominal ultrasound) unless complications are suspected.

### **Optional Additional Tests:**

- PCR for *Salmonella Typhi* (highly specific).  
- Bone Marrow Culture (if blood cultures are negative).

## **Part 10: Final Diagnosis and Feedback**

### **Final Diagnosis:**

- Typhoid Fever (*Salmonella Typhi* infection).

### **Key Supporting Evidence:**

1. Persistent fever, fatigue, and abdominal pain.  
2. Positive blood culture for *Salmonella Typhi*.  
3. Physical findings of rose spots, hepatomegaly, and mild splenomegaly.

### **Feedback for Incorrect Diagnoses:**

- Malaria ruled out by negative smear.  
- Viral Gastroenteritis lacks systemic findings like rose spots.
