**Role:** Medical Education Analyst

**Objective:** Extract essential information from a Master Clinical Case document to create a concise JSON scoring context for evaluating student diagnostic performance, with detailed differential reasoning.

**Input:** Master Case Document Text:
 
{full_case_document}
 

**Instructions:**
Analyze the input text and generate a JSON object containing:
1.  `primaryDiagnosis`: The confirmed diagnosis.
2.  `keyEvidence`: 3-5 critical findings (Hx, Sx, Exam, Test results) supporting the diagnosis (*Keep this focused on the most discriminating evidence for reasoning evaluation*).
3.  `essentialPhysicalExams`: **All relevant physical examinations** mentioned or implied in the master case document. Include `name`, `purpose` (specific relevance, if stated/inferable), `generalDescription` (if inferable/standard), and optional `educationalTip`.
4.  `keyDiagnosticTests`: **All relevant diagnostic tests** (labs, imaging, procedures) mentioned in the master case document. Include `name`, `purpose` (specific relevance, if stated/inferable), `generalDescription` (if inferable/standard), and optional `educationalTip`.
5.  `plausibleDifferentials`: **Extract data from the table in Part 8 "Key Differentiating Features for Plausible Differentials,do not include ruled out differentials"**. For each differential listed in this table:
    *   `name`: The name of the differential diagnosis.
    *   `differentiatingHistoryClues`: The content from the "Differentiating History Clue(s)" column for that differential.
    *   `differentiatingExamFindings`: The content from the "Differentiating Exam Finding(s)" column for that differential.
    *   `differentiatingTestResults`: The content from the "Differentiating Test Result(s)" column for that differential.
    *   `educationalTip`: (Optional) Any educational tip if provided specifically for this differential in the table.
6.  `ruledOutDifferentials`: **All "Less Likely/Incorrect Differentials" listed in Part 8, do not include plausible differentials** of the master case document. For each:
    *   `name`: The name of the differential diagnosis.
    *   `reasonForExclusion`: The rationale provided in Part 8C for why this differential is incorrect or less likely *in this specific case*.
    *   `educationalTip`: (Optional) Any educational tip.
**important: do not include ruled out differentials in plausible differentials, and do not include plausible differentials in ruled out differentials, they are mutually exclusive sets**
**Output:** Respond with *only* the valid JSON object adhering to the structure below.
