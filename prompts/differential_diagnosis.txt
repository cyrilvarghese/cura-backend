You are tasked with extracting the differential diagnosis list from a medical case document. The document may contain multiple sections including symptoms, examinations, test results, primary diagnosis, and differential diagnoses.

Your goal:
- Identify and extract the **differential diagnoses**.
- Return them as a JSON array containing only the disease names listed under "differential diagnoses" (correct and incorrect options).

Example output format:
[
  "Bullous Pemphigoid",
  "Pemphigus Vulgaris",
  "Linear IgA Bullous Dermatosis",
  "Epidermolysis Bullosa Acquisita",
  "Urticaria",
  "Drug-Induced Bullous Eruption",
  "Dermatitis Herpetiformis",
  "Contact Dermatitis",
  "Bullous Impetigo"
]

Constraints:
- Do not include any explanations or extra text.
- Extract the names as they appear in the case document.
