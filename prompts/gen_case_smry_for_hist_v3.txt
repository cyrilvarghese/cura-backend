 
# üìù Prompt: Extract History Summary (Revised Fixed Keys/Structure) and Expected Questions with Domains

**Persona:** You are a **Clinical Case Analyst and Medical Education Content Creator**.

**Context:** You are processing comprehensive clinical case documents to extract specific components needed for an AI-driven feedback system focused on student history-taking skills.

**Objective:** Read the provided full clinical case document and generate a single JSON object containing two distinct components:
1.  `case_summary_history`: A JSON object with a **fixed set of top-level keys and specific internal structures** for some keys, summarizing the essential patient history information. Populate keys with available information or use designated null/empty values if information is absent.
2.  `expected_questions_with_domains`: A JSON array containing objects, where each object includes the text of a key question a student should ask during history-taking *and* its corresponding domain tag from a predefined list.

**Input Data:**
*   `full_case_document`: The complete text content of the clinical case document.

**Output:**
*   A single JSON object containing two top-level keys: `case_summary_history` (object with fixed structure) and `expected_questions_with_domains` (array of objects).

---

**Reference: Predefined History Domains**
*(Use this list to assign domain tags to the expected questions in Task 4)*
*   `chief_complaint`: Clarifying the main symptom (onset, duration, intensity, character).
*   `associated_symptoms`: Related symptoms supporting or challenging the diagnosis.
*   `past_medical_history`: Past illnesses, surgeries, relevant health events.
*   `family_history`: Genetic, hereditary, or exposure-based risks.
*   `medications`: Drug history, allergies, recent treatments (incl. OTC/supplements).
*   `social_exposure`: Lifestyle, occupational, travel, sexual history, triggers, diet.
*   `red_flag_symptoms`: Systemic signs suggesting severe disease or complications.
*   `differential_diagnoses`: Questions specifically aimed at distinguishing between likely possibilities.

## üìÑ Full Case Document (Input):

{full_case_document}

## üß† Your Tasks:

1.  **Read and Analyze History:** Carefully read the entire ` full_case_document `. Identify all sections related to the patient's history. Pay close attention to details needed for the specific structured output below.
2.  **Exclude Non-History Information:** Explicitly **ignore and exclude** information related to physical examination findings, lab results, diagnostic reasoning, treatment plans, etc., *when constructing the history summary*.
3.  **Generate `case_summary_history` JSON (Revised Fixed Structure):**
    *   Create a JSON object that **must include all** of the following top-level keys, adhering to the specified internal structures:
        *   `chief_complaint` (string | null) - *Primary reason for visit.*
        *   `history_of_present_illness` (string | null) - *Narrative description of the evolution of the chief complaint and related symptoms.*
        *   `history_timeline` (object | null) - *Must contain keys `onset` (string | null) and `progression` (string | null). Describe start time/event and how symptoms changed over time.*
        *   `demographics_risk` (object | null) - *Must contain keys `age` (number | null), `gender` (string | null), `occupation` (string | null), `residence` (string | null), and `risk_factors` (array of strings | []).*
        *   `associated_symptoms` (object | null) - *Categorize symptoms by system (e.g., `neurological`, `skin`, `systemic`, `musculoskeletal`, `gastrointestinal`, etc.). Each category should be a key with a value that is an array of strings describing symptoms in that category. Create categories relevant to the case.*
        *   `pertinent_positives` (array of strings | []) - *List key findings present in the history supporting likely diagnoses.*
        *   `pertinent_negatives_from_history` (array of strings | []) - *List key findings explicitly absent in the history that help rule out diagnoses.*
        *   `past_medical_history` (string | null) - *Summary of relevant past conditions, surgeries.*
        *   `family_history` (string | null) - *Summary of relevant conditions in relatives.*
        *   `medications_allergies` (string | null) - *Summary of current meds (Rx, OTC, supplements) and allergies.*
        *   `social_history` (string | null) - *Summary of relevant lifestyle factors (occupation, travel, habits, sexual history, diet).*
    *   Synthesize the extracted history information from the `full_case_document` and populate the corresponding key's value according to the required structure.
    *   **Handling Missing Information:**
        *   If information for a top-level key (expecting string or object) is absent, use `null`.
        *   If information for a top-level key (expecting array) is absent, use `[]`.
        *   For nested keys (like inside `history_timeline` or `demographics_risk` expecting string/number), use `null` if info is absent.
        *   For nested keys (like `risk_factors` array inside `demographics_risk` or category arrays inside `associated_symptoms`), use `[]` if info is absent.
        *   If `associated_symptoms` has no symptoms to report at all, its value should be `null`  .
    *   Keep the extracted information concise and factual.
    *   *Example Structure:*
        ```json
         "case_summary_history": {{ 
            "chief_complaint": "Sudden swelling, redness, and pain over pre-existing skin lesions with new nerve pain in the right hand for 1 week.",
            "history_of_present_illness": "Patient describes an acute exacerbation of skin patches previously diagnosed (implicitly or explicitly) as leprosy, now inflamed. Simultaneously developed severe burning pain along the ulnar aspect of the right hand/forearm with difficulty gripping.",
            "history_timeline": {{
                "onset": "1 week ago",
                "progression": "Acute inflammation of existing lesions developed alongside pain and swelling over the right ulnar nerve."
            }}, 
            "demographics_risk": {{
                "age": 31,
                "gender": "Male",
                "occupation": "Agricultural worker",
                "residence": "Rural endemic area in South India",
                "risk_factors": [ "Living in a leprosy-endemic area" ]
            }},
            "associated_symptoms": {{
                "neurological": [ "Burning and constant pain in the right ulnar nerve distribution", "Weakness in gripping objects" ],
                "skin": [ "Redness", "Swelling", "Tenderness in pre-existing skin patches" ]
                 // Add other categories like "systemic": [] if none mentioned, or omit if truly none apply
            }},
            "pertinent_positives": [ "Acute inflammation of pre-existing skin lesions", "Pain and swelling localized over the right ulnar nerve path", "Sensory symptoms (burning pain) in nerve distribution", "Motor symptoms (weakness) in nerve distribution", "Resides in endemic area" ],
            "pertinent_negatives_from_history": [ "No fever reported", "No joint pain mentioned", "No symptoms suggestive of ENL (e.g., fever, nodules, systemic upset)", "No similar past episodes reported", "No known leprosy contacts mentioned", "No new skin lesions reported" ],
            "past_medical_history": "Reports no significant past medical history.", // Or null if none mentioned
            "family_history": null, // Assuming none mentioned
            "medications_allergies": "Reports no current medications and no known allergies.", // Or null
            "social_history": "Works as agricultural laborer in South India." // Or null
        }}
        ```

4.  **Generate `expected_questions_with_domains` JSON Array (Objects):**
    *   Based on the *entire* case document, identify the *most important* history questions.
    *   If the case document lists required questions, use them as a primary source, have atleast 6 questions.
    *   Formulate each question clearly.
    *   **Assign the most appropriate domain tag** to each question using the `Predefined History Domains` list.
    *   Create a JSON object for each question: `{{"question": "...", "domain": "..." }}`.
    *   Combine these objects into a single JSON array.
    *   *(Example questions remain the same as previous prompt version)*

5.  **Format Final Output:** Combine the generated `case_summary_history` object (with its revised fixed structure) and the `expected_questions_with_domains` array into a single parent JSON object.
