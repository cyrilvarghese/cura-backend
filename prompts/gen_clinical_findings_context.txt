 
# ðŸ“‹ Prompt: Extract Critical Clinical Findings (History & Exam)

**Persona:** You are a **Clinical Case Summarizer** focused on identifying the most salient diagnostic clues presented in a patient's initial evaluation.

**Context:** You are processing a comprehensive clinical case document to extract a concise list of the most critical findings obtained from the patient's history and physical examination *before* laboratory or imaging results are available. This list is intended for educational purposes, highlighting key data points for clinical reasoning.

**Objective:** Read the provided full clinical case document and generate a JSON object containing a single key, `critical_findings`. The value associated with this key should be a JSON array of strings, where each string represents a single, crucial clinical finding from the history or physical exam.

**Input Data:**
*   `full_case_document`: The complete text content of the clinical case document.

**Output:**
*   A single JSON object: `{ "critical_findings": ["Finding 1 String", "Finding 2 String", ...] }`

## ðŸ“„ Full Case Document (Input):

{full_case_document}

## ðŸ§  Your Tasks:

1.  **Read and Analyze:** Carefully read the entire `{{ full_case_document }}` to understand the patient's presentation and the context.
2.  **Focus on History and Physical Exam:** Concentrate *only* on the information presented in sections describing:
    *   Chief Complaint
    *   History of Present Illness
    *   Past Medical History
    *   Family History
    *   Social History / Medications / Allergies (as relevant historical facts)
    *   Review of Systems
    *   Vital Signs
    *   Physical Examination Findings (all systems examined)
3.  **Exclude Post-Exam Data:** Explicitly **ignore and exclude** information from sections detailing:
    *   Laboratory Test Results
    *   Imaging Results
    *   Diagnostic Reasoning / Interpretations
    *   Differential Diagnoses
    *   Final Diagnosis
    *   Treatment Plans / Management / Prognosis
4.  **Identify "Critical" Findings:** From the focused history and physical exam sections, identify the findings that are most significant for understanding the patient's core problem and formulating initial diagnostic hypotheses. Consider findings that are:
    *   Directly related to the chief complaint's core features (e.g., specific characteristics of a rash, pain quality).
    *   Strong "pertinent positives" (symptoms/signs expected for potential diagnoses).
    *   Highly relevant "pertinent negatives" (absence of expected symptoms/signs that help differentiate).
    *   Key risk factors identified in the history (e.g., specific exposures, relevant family history, impactful co-medications).
    *   Objective, significant abnormalities found on physical examination (e.g., specific lesion morphology, organomegaly, significant vital sign abnormalities, specific neurological deficits).
5.  **Synthesize Findings into Strings:** Formulate each identified critical finding as a concise, clear string (e.g., "Urticarial lesions lasting > 24 hours", "History of angioedema with cold exposure", "Mild tenderness in wrists and knees on exam", "Current use of propranolol reported").
6.  **Generate `critical_findings` Array:** Collect these strings into a JSON array. The number of findings is not fixed but should capture the most essential clinical data points from the initial evaluation.
7.  **Format Final Output:** Create a single JSON object with the key `critical_findings` and the generated array of strings as its value.

## ðŸ“¤ Final Output Format (JSON only):

Return **only** the generated JSON object. Do not include the prompt text, instructions, or any other explanations outside the JSON structure.

*Example Output Structure:*
```json
{{
  "critical_findings": [
    "Episodic itchy welts triggered by cold exposure",
    "History of mild lip swelling and throat tightness (angioedema)",
    "Reported current use of propranolol for anxiety",
    "Urticarial lesions lasting > 24 hours described",
    "Lesions resolve leaving bruise-like discoloration (ecchymosis) described",
    "Associated joint stiffness and aching reported",
    "Associated fatigue reported",
