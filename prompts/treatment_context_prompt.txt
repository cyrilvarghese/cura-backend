//only protocol has been added - need to add the rest of the sections like pre-treatment investigations, monitoring, contraindicated drugs, additional instructions and format the output in structured Markdown so that each section is clearly labeled and machine-readable.

#### üíä Treatment Protocol (Enhanced for Clinical Reasoning & Teaching Context)

Write a structured treatment plan for this condition, designed to help medical students understand not only **what to use**, but **why**.

Please include:

---

### ‚úÖ 1. First-Line Treatment
- List recommended first-line drugs.
- Include common drug examples (generic name preferred).
- Include typical dosing or usage instructions.
- Add **brief rationale**: what symptom or mechanism does this address?

---

### ‚öñÔ∏è 2. Escalation / Second-Line
- What is used in moderate-to-severe cases?
- When should this be added or substituted?
- Include dose ranges if applicable.
- Include a rationale for escalation (e.g., non-response, systemic features).

---

### üí° 3. Steroid-Sparing or Refractory Options
- What drugs are used for chronic or difficult-to-control cases?
- What considerations (e.g., monitoring, slow onset) are needed for these drugs?

---

### ‚ùå 4. Contraindicated or Cautionary Drugs
- Mention drugs that should be stopped or avoided in this case.
- Explain why (e.g., interaction risk, blunted emergency response).
- Include what happens if they are continued.

---

### üí¨ Additional Instructions (Optional)
- Include any non-drug guidance (e.g., patient education, environmental changes).
- Summarize in a way that allows learners to **build decision pathways**.
