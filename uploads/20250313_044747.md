# **Master Case: Vitiligo**

## **Part 1: Case Description**

A 28-year-old male presents to the dermatology clinic with progressively expanding **pale patches** on his hands, face, and neck over the past **8 months**. The lesions are **asymptomatic**, but he is distressed due to their visibility.  

The patient reports that the patches started as **small, well-defined spots** and have gradually increased in size. He denies **any itching, scaling, or pain**.  

He has a **family history of vitiligo**, as his mother developed similar patches in her late 30s. He also has a history of **seasonal allergies and autoimmune thyroid disease**.  

No history of **trauma, burns, chemical exposure**, or prior skin infections. He has not tried any treatment yet but has attempted **cosmetic camouflage products**.

## **Part 2: Primary Symptoms**

- **Well-defined depigmented macules and patches** on the hands, face, and neck.  
- **No scaling, erythema, or signs of inflammation**.  
- **Lesions are asymptomatic** (no itching, pain, or burning).  
- **Gradual expansion of lesions over several months**.  
- **Family history of vitiligo and autoimmune thyroid disease**.  

### **Relevant Questions for Information Gathering**
1. When did you first notice the patches, and have they changed over time?  
2. Do you have a family history of similar skin conditions or autoimmune diseases?  
3. Have you noticed any itching, burning, or changes in texture within the patches?  
4. Have you been exposed to chemicals, trauma, or sunburns that may have triggered these changes?  

### **Non-Relevant Factors**
- No history of **scaling, redness, or raised lesions** (rules out eczema, psoriasis, tinea).  
- No history of **recent medication changes**.  
- No **systemic symptoms** like fever or weight loss.

## **Part 3: Relevant Background Information**

### **Relevant Factors**
- **Family history of vitiligo** and autoimmune thyroid disease.  
- **Gradual, progressive onset of depigmented macules**.  
- **No associated symptoms** (itching, pain, inflammation).  

### **Non-Relevant Factors**
- No history of **infectious skin diseases** (tinea versicolor, leprosy).  
- No use of **skin-lightening products** or new cosmetic agents.  
- No **history of physical trauma or burns** affecting the lesion sites.

## **Part 4: Master List of Physical Examinations**

1. **General skin examination** – to assess lesion distribution and morphology.  
2. **Wood’s lamp examination** – to enhance lesion contrast under UV light.  
3. **Dermatological examination of mucosa** – check lips, oral cavity, and genitals.  
4. **Examine scalp and hair** – check for associated leukotrichia (white hair).  
5. **Nail examination** – evaluate for nail dystrophy (rare in vitiligo).  
6. **Check for signs of Koebner phenomenon** – new lesions appearing after skin trauma.  
7. **Thyroid palpation** – assess for goiter or tenderness (related to autoimmune thyroid disease).  
8. **Ophthalmic examination** – check for uveitis (associated with vitiligo).  
9. **Neurological exam** – assess for sensory loss (rules out leprosy).

## **Part 5: Master List of Lab Tests**

1. **Wood’s lamp examination** – essential to confirm lesion fluorescence.  
2. **Thyroid function tests (TSH, T3, T4)** – screen for autoimmune thyroid disease.  
3. **Anti-thyroid peroxidase (Anti-TPO) antibodies** – assess autoimmune association.  
4. **ANA (Antinuclear Antibody) test** – rule out other autoimmune diseases.  
5. **Skin biopsy (if uncertain diagnosis)** – reveals loss of melanocytes in vitiligo.  
6. **Serum Vitamin D levels** – vitiligo patients may have deficiencies.  
7. **Fasting blood glucose & HbA1c** – screen for type 1 diabetes, common in vitiligo patients.  
8. **Serum cortisol & ACTH** – assess for adrenal insufficiency if Addison’s disease is suspected.  
9. **Complete Blood Count (CBC)** – rule out anemia or systemic involvement.  
10. **Fungal culture (if tinea versicolor suspected)** – differentiates from infectious causes.

## **Part 6: Initial Case Presentation and Information Gathering**

### **Required Patient History Questions**
1. When did you first notice the white patches, and how have they progressed?  
2. Do you have any family history of vitiligo or autoimmune diseases?  
3. Have you noticed any itching, burning, or texture changes in the affected skin?  
4. Have you recently experienced excessive sun exposure, trauma, or chemical exposure?  
5. Have you had any symptoms suggestive of thyroid dysfunction (fatigue, weight changes, palpitations)?

## **Part 7: Primary Diagnosis and Reasoning**

### **Expected Primary Diagnosis**  
- **Vitiligo**  

### **Key Reasoning Points**
1. **Depigmented, well-defined macules** with no signs of inflammation.  
2. **Positive family history of vitiligo** and autoimmune conditions.  
3. **Progressive course with no scaling, itching, or burning** (rules out tinea or eczema).  
4. **Wood’s lamp positive** – enhances depigmented areas.  

---

## **Part 8: Differential Diagnoses and Refinement**

1. **Vitiligo (Correct)**  
2. **Tinea Versicolor (Incorrect)** – Shows fine scaling, not pure depigmentation.  
3. **Leprosy (Incorrect)** – Sensory loss in affected areas.  
4. **Post-inflammatory hypopigmentation (Incorrect)** – Typically resolves spontaneously.  

---

## **Part 9: Diagnostic Testing and Interpretation**

- **Wood’s Lamp Examination:** Enhances vitiligo patches.  
- **Skin Biopsy (if needed):** Confirms melanocyte loss.  
- **Thyroid Testing:** Screens for autoimmune association.

## **Part 10: Final Diagnosis and Feedback**

### **Final Diagnosis**
- **Vitiligo**  

### **Key Supporting Evidence**
1. **Classic clinical features** – depigmented, well-demarcated patches.  
2. **Wood’s lamp findings** – fluorescent under UV light.  
3. **Autoimmune association** – family history of thyroid disease.

## **Part 12: Management & Treatment Plan**

### **First-Line Treatments**
1. **Topical corticosteroids** (Clobetasol, Mometasone) – for localized vitiligo.  
2. **Topical calcineurin inhibitors** (Tacrolimus, Pimecrolimus) – for facial/mucosal areas.  
3. **Phototherapy (NB-UVB)** – for widespread lesions.  

### **Advanced Therapies**
1. **Excimer laser therapy** – for resistant small patches.  
2. **Depigmentation therapy (Monobenzone)** – for extensive vitiligo.  
3. **JAK inhibitors (Ruxolitinib cream)** – emerging therapy.  

### **Long-Term Management**
- **Sun protection** for depigmented areas.  
- **Psychosocial support** for patient distress.  
- **Regular monitoring for autoimmune conditions**.
