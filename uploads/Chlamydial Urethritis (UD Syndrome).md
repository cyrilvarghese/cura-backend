### **Part 12: Management & Treatment Plan**

#### 🧪 Pre-Treatment & Baseline Investigations

| Investigation | Purpose | Relevant Drug(s) |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| NAAT | Confirm *C. trachomatis* | Doxycycline / Azithromycin |
| Gram stain | Exclude gonorrhea | Doxycycline |
| HIV, RPR, HBsAg | Syndromic screen | None |
| Urinalysis | Rule out UTI | None |
| Partner evaluation | Determine exposure risk | Azithromycin safe in pregnancy |

#### 🔁 Monitoring During & After Treatment

| Time Point | Test | Purpose | Drug(s) |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Day 7 | Clinical check | Symptom resolution | Doxycycline |
| 3 months | Repeat NAAT (high-risk) | Reinfection screen | – |
| Follow-ups | Partner check, condom counseling | Prevent recurrence | All |

#### 💊 Structured Treatment Plan

- **Doxycycline 100 mg PO BID × 7 days** ✅ Preferred  
- **Azithromycin 1g PO single dose** ✅ Acceptable alternative  
- **Moxifloxacin 400 mg/day × 7–10 days** ⚖️ Persistent NGU (MG suspected)

#### ❌ Contraindicated

- Ciprofloxacin – outdated due to resistance  
- Tetracycline – short-acting, poor adherence  
- Monotherapy without partner treatment

#### 🛡️ Supportive & Preventive

- Abstinence till 7 days post-treatment  
- Partner treatment (last 60 days)  
- Counseling: safer sex, testing, condom use  
- Discharge instructions & STI referral

#### 📈 Prognosis & Long-Term

- Prognosis: Excellent with early Rx  
- Retesting: At 3 months (if high-risk)  
- Fertility: Preserved if treated early  
- Recurrence: Usually due to untreated partner

### **Part 13: OSCE Stations**

#### 🔹 Station 1: Focused History – Suspected NGU

**Scenario:** A 22-year-old male presents to the clinic with a 5-day history of mild burning during urination and a small amount of urethral discharge.

**Instructions:** Conduct a focused sexual and urogenital history. Ask 5–6 relevant questions to assess for non-gonococcal urethritis.

**Expected Questions:**

1. When did the symptoms begin?  
2. What does the discharge look like (color, quantity, timing)?  
3. Have you had unprotected sexual contact recently? With how many partners?  
4. Have you or your partner(s) ever had an STI before?  
5. Any other symptoms like fever, joint pain, rash, or eye irritation?  
6. Have you taken any antibiotics recently?

**Assessment Criteria:** Ability to take a detailed, non-judgmental, risk-focused history; clarity and appropriateness of questions.

---

#### 🔹 Station 2: Image-Based / Physical Exam Findings

**Scenario:** You are shown a high-resolution clinical image of a penis with clear mucoid urethral discharge and mild meatal erythema.

**Instructions:** Identify the most likely condition and describe 2–3 relevant physical findings.

**Expected Response:**

- **Diagnosis:** Non-gonococcal urethritis (likely *Chlamydia trachomatis*)  
- **Findings:**  
  - Scant clear or mucoid discharge at the urethral meatus  
  - Mild meatal erythema (no ulceration or crusting)  
  - Absence of inguinal lymphadenopathy or systemic signs

**Assessment Criteria:** Recognition of visual features and correct interpretation aligned with Chlamydial urethritis.

---

#### 🔹 Station 3: Diagnostic Test Interpretation and Management

**Scenario:** The following results are available for a patient:

- NAAT: Positive for *Chlamydia trachomatis*, Negative for *N. gonorrhoeae*  
- Gram stain: PMNs seen, no intracellular gram-negative diplococci  
- Wet mount: Negative for T. vaginalis  
- HIV, RPR: Non-reactive

**Instructions:** Interpret these findings, make a diagnosis, and outline the treatment and preventive steps.

**Expected Response:**

- **Diagnosis:** Confirmed chlamydial urethritis (uncomplicated NGU)  
- **Treatment:** Doxycycline 100 mg PO BID × 7 days (or Azithromycin 1g single dose if non-adherent)  
- **Additional Steps:**  
  - Advise sexual abstinence for 7 days after treatment  
  - Initiate partner notification and ensure partner treatment  
  - Provide counseling on condom use and repeat testing in 3 months if high-risk

**Assessment Criteria:** Ability to synthesize lab results into a clinical decision, recommend appropriate therapy, and include public health components like partner management.

### **Part 14: MCQs**

#### ❓ MCQ 1: Classic Presentation

**Which of the following is most characteristic of *Chlamydia trachomatis* urethritis in men?**

A. Copious purulent discharge and high-grade fever  
B. Scant, clear to mucoid urethral discharge with mild dysuria  
C. Painful vesicular lesions and tender lymph nodes  
D. Frothy greenish discharge with intense itching

✅ **Correct Answer:** B

**Explanation:**  
Chlamydia often presents with mild symptoms—scant, clear or mucoid discharge and burning at urination.

- **A:** Suggests gonococcal urethritis (thick, purulent discharge and possible fever)  
- **C:** Suggests herpes (painful vesicles and systemic symptoms)  
- **D:** Suggests *T. vaginalis* (more common in females, frothy discharge)

---

#### ❓ MCQ 2: Most Sensitive Diagnostic Test

**What is the most sensitive and specific test for diagnosing Chlamydial urethritis?**

A. Wet mount microscopy  
B. Gram stain of urethral swab  
C. NAAT (Nucleic Acid Amplification Test)  
D. Urethral culture

✅ **Correct Answer:** C

**Explanation:**  
NAAT is the gold standard for detecting *C. trachomatis*. Highly sensitive and specific from urine or swab.

- **A:** Poor sensitivity for Chlamydia (better for *T. vaginalis*)  
- **B:** Good for gonorrhea, not Chlamydia  
- **D:** Cultures are not routinely used for Chlamydia due to complexity

---

#### ❓ MCQ 3: Treatment Guideline

**According to national guidelines, what is the first-line treatment for uncomplicated chlamydial urethritis?**

A. Azithromycin 500 mg single dose  
B. Ciprofloxacin 500 mg BID × 3 days  
C. Doxycycline 100 mg BID × 7 days  
D. Metronidazole 2g single dose

✅ **Correct Answer:** C

**Explanation:**  
Doxycycline is the recommended first-line treatment. Azithromycin may be used if adherence is a concern.

- **A:** Incorrect dose and monotherapy less preferred  
- **B:** No longer used due to resistance  
- **D:** Used for *T. vaginalis*, not *C. trachomatis*
