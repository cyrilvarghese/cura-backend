- **Sexual history:** Recent unprotected encounter with a sex worker 7 days prior.
- **Social:** Smoker, occasional alcohol; no IV drug use.
- **No history of fever or systemic symptoms.**

---

### **Part 2: Primary Symptoms**

- **Painful genital ulcer**: Deep, soft, necrotic center, irregular border (‚ú≥Ô∏è Image needed)
- **Unilateral painful inguinal lymphadenopathy** (bubo) (‚ú≥Ô∏è Image needed)
- **Possible multiple ulcers** in some cases
- **Burning micturition**, **dyspareunia**
- **No systemic illness**, no urethral discharge

---

### **Part 3: Relevant Background Information**

**Relevant:**
- Unprotected sex with sex worker
- Rapid ulceration after exposure
- Painful lymphadenopathy
- Absence of systemic illness

**Irrelevant:**
- Tobacco use (not directly related)
- No fever or skin lesions elsewhere
- No past STI history

### **Part 4: Master List of Physical Examinations**

| Physical Exam | Relevance | Notes |
|---------------|-----------|-------|
| **Genital exam** | ‚úÖ High | **Deep, painful ulcer** with purulent base (‚ú≥Ô∏è Image needed) |
| **Inguinal node exam** | ‚úÖ High | **Tender unilateral bubo**, fluctuant (‚ú≥Ô∏è Image needed) |
| **Abdominal exam** | ‚úÖ Moderate | Rule out deep lymphadenitis |
| **Rectal exam** | ‚ùå Low | Not typically involved |
| **Oral inspection** | ‚ùå Low | No oral lesions in typical chancroid |
| **Skin survey** | ‚ùå Low | No systemic rash |

### **Part 5: Master List of Lab Tests**

| Test | Relevance | Notes |
|------|-----------|-------|
| **Gram stain of ulcer exudate** | ‚úÖ High | School of fish pattern; sensitivity low (‚ú≥Ô∏è Image needed) |
| **Culture for *H. ducreyi*** | ‚úÖ High | Requires special media (‚ú≥Ô∏è Image needed) |
| **PCR for *H. ducreyi*** | ‚úÖ High | Highly sensitive/specific (if available) |
| **NAAT for HSV, Syphilis, Chlamydia** | ‚úÖ High | Rule out co-infections |
| **HIV serology** | ‚úÖ High | STI risk profile |
| **VDRL / TPHA** | ‚úÖ High | Rule out syphilis |
| **CBC** | ‚úÖ Moderate | May show mild leukocytosis |
| **Urinalysis** | ‚ùå Low | Not involved unless secondary UTI suspected |

### **Part 6: Initial Case Presentation & History Taking**

**Key Questions:**
- When did the ulcer start?
- Was there any pain at onset?
- Sexual contact history (type, protection)?
- Any past STI diagnosis or treatments?

**Vitals:**
- Temp: Normal
- HR: Mildly elevated
- BP: Normal

**Physical Findings:**
- Painful necrotic ulcer, erythematous base
- Unilateral tender groin lymph node

---

### **Part 7: Primary Diagnosis and Reasoning**

**Diagnosis:** Chancroid (*Haemophilus ducreyi*)

**Key Points:**
- Rapid ulceration
- Tender lesion
- Unilateral painful bubo
- No systemic signs

**Pitfalls:**
- Mistaking it for syphilis (painless)
- HSV ulcers are multiple, smaller, and vesicular

---

### **Part 8: Differential Diagnoses**

**Correct Differentials:**
- **HSV**: Multiple, painful vesicles, usually bilateral
- **Syphilis**: Painless chancre, firm base, no tender nodes
- **LGV (C. trachomatis L1‚ÄìL3)**: Painless ulcer, tender bubo + systemic signs

**Incorrect Differentials:**
- **Fungal balanitis**: No ulcer, itchy
- **Beh√ßet's syndrome**: Genital ulcers + systemic vasculitis

---

### **Part 9: Diagnostic Testing and Interpretation**

| Test | Expected Result |
|------|------------------|
| Gram stain | Gram-negative rods in chains/school of fish |
| Culture | Positive growth on enriched chocolate agar |
| PCR | Positive for *H. ducreyi* |
| NAAT (HSV, Syphilis) | Negative |
| HIV / TPHA / VDRL | May be positive in co-infections |

---

### **Part 10: Final Diagnosis and Feedback**

**Final Diagnosis:** Chancroid (*Haemophilus ducreyi*)

**Feedback:**
- Always differentiate painful vs. painless ulcers
- Collect lesion swabs before initiating treatment
- Rule out HSV and syphilis co-infection

### **Part 11: Management & Treatment Plan**

#### üß™ Pre-Treatment Investigations

| Test | Purpose | Drug(s) |
|------|---------|---------|
| HIV, VDRL, TPHA | Screen coinfections | Azithromycin, Ceftriaxone |
| Gram stain / Culture | Confirm diagnosis | ‚Äî |
| CBC | General infection status | ‚Äî |

#### üîÅ Monitoring During Treatment

| Time | Test | Purpose |
|------|------|---------|
| Day 0 | Clinical inspection | Confirm chancroid |
| Day 3‚Äì5 | Assess ulcer improvement | Response to antibiotics |
| Day 7 | Groin bubo reassessment | Consider drainage if needed |

#### üíä Treatment

- **Azithromycin 1 g PO single dose** *or*
- **Ceftriaxone 250 mg IM single dose**
- Alternatives: Ciprofloxacin 500 mg BID √ó 3 days
- Treat sexual contacts from past 10 days

#### üõ°Ô∏è Supportive Care

- Warm compresses for bubo
- Pain relief: NSAIDs or paracetamol
- Safe sex counseling
- Abstain from intercourse until healing

#### üìà Prognosis

- Excellent with early treatment
- Ulcer healing within 7‚Äì14 days
- Buboes may take longer; drainage may be needed
