---

### **Part 2: Primary Symptoms**

- **Painless beefy red ulcer** with granulating, friable base (‚ú≥Ô∏è Image needed)
- **Bleeds easily** when touched
- **No regional lymphadenopathy** (distinguishes from LGV or chancroid)
- **No systemic symptoms** (e.g., no fever, malaise)
- **Slow progressive enlargement** of lesion

---

### **Part 3: Relevant Background**

**Relevant Factors:**

- Painless progressive ulceration
- Bleeding, friable lesion
- No lymphadenopathy

**Irrelevant/Confounding:**
- Smoking, alcohol (not directly causative)
- Absence of fever/systemic symptoms
- No history of diabetes or HIV (though would affect course if present)

### **Part 4: Master List of Physical Examinations (‚ú≥Ô∏è Image Needed where marked)**

| Physical Exam | Relevance | Notes |
|---------------|-----------|-------|
| **Genital exam (‚ú≥Ô∏è Image needed)** | ‚úÖ High | **Painless, beefy red ulcer** with rolled edges, bleeds on touch |
| **Inguinal node palpation** | ‚úÖ Moderate | Usually **not enlarged** in Donovanosis |
| **Skin survey** | ‚úÖ Moderate | Rule out secondary spread or coinfection |
| **Rectal exam** | ‚ùå Low | Rarely involved unless perianal lesion present |
| **Oral cavity exam** | ‚ùå Low | No oral lesions expected in typical case |
| **Abdominal exam** | ‚ùå Low | Not typically relevant unless systemic spread suspected |

### **Part 5: Master List of Lab Tests (‚ú≥Ô∏è Image Needed where marked)**

| Test | Relevance | Notes |
|------|-----------|-------|
| **Tissue smear with Giemsa stain (‚ú≥Ô∏è Image needed)** | ‚úÖ High | Shows **Donovan bodies** inside macrophages (diagnostic) |
| **Wright or Leishman stain (‚ú≥Ô∏è Image needed)** | ‚úÖ High | Also shows Donovan bodies; alternative to Giemsa |
| **PCR (if available)** | ‚úÖ High | Detects *K. granulomatis* genes |
| **HIV serology** | ‚úÖ High | Coinfection may affect ulcer healing and progression |
| **VDRL/TPHA** | ‚úÖ High | Rule out syphilis coinfection |
| **NAAT for HSV, LGV, Chancroid** | ‚úÖ High | Exclude other ulcerative STIs |
| **CBC** | ‚úÖ Moderate | May show mild anemia or chronic inflammation |
| **Culture** | ‚ùå Not routinely available; organism difficult to grow |

### **Part 6: Initial Case Presentation & History**

**Key Questions:**
- When did the ulcer start, and how has it progressed?
- Any pain or bleeding?
- Recent sexual activity and condom use?
- Any past history of similar ulcers or STIs?

**Vitals:**
- Temp: Normal  
- HR: Normal  
- BP: Normal

**Physical Findings:**
- **Solitary beefy red ulcer** on penile shaft with rolled edge and active bleeding on touch
- No groin lymphadenopathy

---

### **Part 7: Primary Diagnosis and Reasoning**

**Primary Diagnosis:** Donovanosis (Granuloma Inguinale)

**Reasoning:**
- Classic **painless**, **beefy red**, **friable ulcer**
- Bleeds easily, slow progression
- **No lymphadenopathy**, distinguishing from chancroid or LGV
- **Donovan bodies** confirm diagnosis

**Pitfalls:**
- Mistaking for syphilis (non-bleeding ulcer)
- Misdiagnosed as carcinoma or LGV

---

### **Part 8: Differential Diagnoses**

**Correct Differentials:**
- **Syphilis (T. pallidum):** Firm, indurated, painless ulcer, no bleeding
- **LGV (C. trachomatis L1‚ÄìL3):** Painless ulcer + bubo
- **Chancroid (H. ducreyi):** Painful, soft ulcer + tender lymph nodes

**Incorrect Differentials:**
- **Genital herpes:** Vesicles ‚Üí shallow ulcers, painful, clustered
- **Carcinoma of penis:** Non-infectious, typically painless, fixed lesion
- **Beh√ßet‚Äôs disease:** Painful aphthous ulcers + systemic vasculitis

### **Part 9: Diagnostic Testing and Interpretation**

| Test | Expected Result |
|------|------------------|
| Giemsa/Wright stain | Intracytoplasmic Donovan bodies (safety-pin appearance) |
| PCR (if done) | Positive for *K. granulomatis* |
| HIV serology | Status to guide prognosis |
| VDRL / TPHA | Negative (if no syphilis) |
| HSV/Chancroid PCR | Negative |
| CBC | Mild anemia possible |

### **Part 10: Final Diagnosis and Feedback**

**Confirmed Diagnosis:** Donovanosis (*Klebsiella granulomatis*)

**Feedback for learners:**
- Always ask about **pain**, **bleeding**, **sexual exposure**
- Painless ulcer that **bleeds** is classic for Donovanosis
- Confirm visually + cytology (Donovan bodies)
- Exclude **co-infections** like syphilis or HIV

### **Part 11: Management & Treatment Plan**

#### üß™ Pre-Treatment Investigations

| Test | Purpose | Drug(s) |
|------|---------|---------|
| Giemsa / Wright stain | Confirm diagnosis | Azithromycin |
| HIV / VDRL / HSV | Rule out co-infections | All |
| CBC | Monitor anemia/inflammation | ‚Äî |

#### üîÅ Monitoring During Treatment

| Time Point | Test | Purpose |
|------------|------|---------|
| Day 0 | Clinical evaluation + smear | Baseline diagnosis |
| Week 1 | Ulcer response | Shrinking, less friability |
| Week 4 | Full healing expected | If not: reassess or consider resistance |

#### üíä Treatment Protocol

- **Azithromycin 1 g orally once/week √ó ‚â•3 weeks** OR until ulcers fully heal
- Alternative: **Doxycycline 100 mg BID for ‚â•21 days**
- Continue treatment **until lesions completely heal**
- Treat sexual partners with presumptive therapy

#### üõ°Ô∏è Supportive Care

- Hygiene education
- Avoid sexual contact until full healing
- Counsel on STI prevention, condom use
- Treat partners from past 60 days

#### üìà Prognosis & Long-Term Plan

- Excellent if treated early
- Risk of scarring or secondary bacterial infection if delayed
- No lifelong immunity ‚Äî reinfection possible
- STI screening annually if high-risk behavior continues
