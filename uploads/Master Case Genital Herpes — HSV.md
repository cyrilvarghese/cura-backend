### **Part 4: Physical Examinations (‚ú≥Ô∏è Image Needed where marked)**

| Physical Exam | Relevance | Notes |
|---------------|-----------|-------|
| **Genital exam (‚ú≥Ô∏è Image needed)** | ‚úÖ High | Vesicles and ulcers on labia, perineum, and vestibule |
| **Inguinal lymph node palpation** | ‚úÖ High | Bilateral tender nodes, may be mildly enlarged |
| **Skin survey** | ‚úÖ Moderate | To rule out secondary herpes or co-infection |
| **Oral exam** | ‚úÖ Moderate | Look for co-existing HSV-1 if orogenital contact |
| **Rectal exam** | ‚ùå Low | Not relevant unless perianal or anal lesions present |
| **Abdominal exam** | ‚ùå Low | Rule out complications in immunocompromised patients |
| **Neurologic exam** | ‚ùå Low | Consider if neuralgia or radiculopathy suspected |
| **Perianal inspection (‚ú≥Ô∏è Image needed)** | ‚úÖ Moderate | If patient engages in receptive anal sex |
| **Pelvic exam** | ‚úÖ Moderate | For cervicitis, discharge, or internal lesions |
| **Eye exam** | ‚ùå Low | Only if systemic HSV suspected (very rare) |

### **Part 5: Lab Tests (‚ú≥Ô∏è Image Needed where marked)**

| Test | Relevance | Notes |
|------|-----------|-------|
| **HSV PCR (‚ú≥Ô∏è Image needed)** | ‚úÖ High | Detects HSV-1 or HSV-2 DNA from lesion swab |
| **Tzanck smear (‚ú≥Ô∏è Image needed)** | ‚úÖ Moderate | Multinucleated giant cells; not type-specific |
| **HSV serology (IgM, IgG)** | ‚úÖ Moderate | May confirm prior exposure; useful if PCR unavailable |
| **HIV test** | ‚úÖ High | Co-testing recommended |
| **VDRL / TPHA** | ‚úÖ Moderate | Rule out syphilis |
| **NAAT for chlamydia/gonorrhea** | ‚úÖ Moderate | Coinfection screening in STI evaluation |
| **Urinalysis** | ‚ùå Low | Pain is external, not urinary tract infection |
| **ESR / CRP** | ‚ùå Low | Non-specific inflammatory markers |
| **Pap smear** | ‚ùå Low | Useful for cervical screening, not acute HSV |
| **Wet mount microscopy (KOH prep)** | ‚ùå Low | For candidiasis, not genital ulcer disease |

### **Part 6: Initial Case Presentation & History Taking**

**Key Questions:**
- When did itching or pain start?
- Did the lesions begin as blisters or ulcers?
- Any new sexual partner or unprotected sex?
- Any prior history of similar symptoms?

**Vitals:**
- Temp: 99.8¬∞F  
- HR: Mildly elevated  
- BP: Normal

**Physical Findings:**
- Clusters of shallow, painful ulcers on labia minora
- Mild bilateral inguinal tenderness

### **Part 7: Primary Diagnosis and Reasoning**

**Diagnosis:** Primary genital herpes (likely HSV-2)

**Reasoning:**
- Grouped vesicles ‚Üí ulceration, with severe dysuria
- Flu-like symptoms (fever, malaise) suggest primary episode
- Lesion morphology and recent unprotected exposure

**Pitfalls:**
- Mistaken for syphilis (painless)
- Confused with candidiasis (itching but no ulcers)

---

### **Part 8: Differential Diagnoses**

**Correct Differentials:**
- **Syphilis (T. pallidum):** Painless, indurated chancre
- **Chancroid (H. ducreyi):** Painful ulcer, but not vesicles first
- **Beh√ßet‚Äôs disease:** Painful oral and genital ulcers

**Incorrect Differentials:**
- **Candidiasis:** Itching, white discharge, no ulcers
- **LGV (C. trachomatis L1‚ÄìL3):** Painless ulcer + bubo
- **UTI:** Burning but no external ulcers

### **Part 9: Diagnostic Testing and Interpretation**

| Test | Expected Result |
|------|------------------|
| HSV PCR | HSV-2 detected from lesion |
| Tzanck smear | Multinucleated giant cells |
| HSV serology | IgM + in primary infection |
| HIV ELISA | Should be tested; may be negative |
| VDRL / TPHA | Negative unless co-infection |

### **Part 10: Final Diagnosis and Feedback**

**Final Diagnosis:** Primary genital herpes simplex virus infection (HSV-2)

**Feedback:**
- Painful vesicles ‚Üí ulcers = classic for herpes
- Always ask about new partners, prodromal symptoms
- Consider first episode vs. recurrence
- Counseling is as important as medication

### **Part 11: Management & Treatment Plan**

#### üß™ Pre-Treatment Investigations

| Test | Purpose | Drug(s) |
|------|---------|---------|
| HSV PCR | Confirm diagnosis | Acyclovir, Valacyclovir |
| HIV, VDRL | Rule out co-infections | ‚Äî |
| Serology | Classify primary vs. recurrent | ‚Äî |

#### üîÅ Monitoring During Treatment

| Time Point | Action | Purpose |
|------------|--------|---------|
| Day 0 | Start antivirals | Reduce duration and pain |
| Day 3 | Check ulcer healing | Monitor response |
| Day 7 | Assess symptom resolution | Evaluate treatment completion |

#### üíä Treatment Protocol

- **Acyclovir 400 mg PO TID √ó 7‚Äì10 days** (primary episode)
- **Alternative:** Valacyclovir 1 g PO BID √ó 7‚Äì10 days
- For recurrences: shorter 1‚Äì5 day regimens possible
- Suppressive therapy if ‚â•6 outbreaks/year

#### üõ°Ô∏è Supportive Care

- Saline soaks, topical lidocaine for pain
- Avoid sex until full healing
- Educate on recurrence and transmission risk
- Partner notification, even if asymptomatic

#### üìà Prognosis & Long-Term Plan

- Primary episodes are more severe
- Virus remains latent; recurrences possible
- Suppression reduces outbreaks and transmission
- Offer annual STI/HIV screening in sexually active individuals
