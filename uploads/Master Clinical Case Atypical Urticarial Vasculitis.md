## Master Clinical Case: Atypical Urticarial Presentation (Cold-Induced Urticaria with Systemic Features)

### **Part 1: Case Description**

**Patient Profile:**

- **Age:** 26 years
- **Gender:** Female
- **Occupation:** Office Manager
- **Residence:** Urban area

**Chief Complaint:**

The patient presents with a one-week history of episodic, intensely itchy welts that occur primarily after cold exposure (e.g., after showering or walking in the wind), accompanied by mild lip swelling and a sense of throat tightness after drinking cold beverages.

**History of Present Illness:**

She first noticed welts after stepping outside on a cold morning, which appeared within minutes and resolved in under an hour. Since then, these hives appear almost daily with cold exposure and are now accompanied by angioedema of the lips on two occasions. One episode followed drinking iced tea, during which she experienced throat tightness that resolved without intervention. She denies shortness of breath or wheezing. There is no fever, joint pain, or systemic malaise.


She explains that she has been dealing with significant anxiety related to recent personal issues, including a breakup and workload stress, which have triggered symptoms of performance anxiety. As a result, she self-medicates with propranolol before high-pressure meetings or presentations. 
She has not taken any new medications recently otherwise. No history of NSAID or food allergies. No prior similar reactions.

**Past Medical History:** Unremarkable.

**Family History:** Mother has rheumatoid arthritis.

**Social History:** Non-smoker, moderate alcohol consumption, no recent travel.

**Review of Systems:****

- **Skin:** Persistent, itchy rash with post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation.
- **Musculoskeletal:** No joint pain or stiffness.
- **General:** No systemic symptoms such as fatigue or malaise.

### **Part 2: Primary Symptoms**

1. **Cutaneous Lesions:**

   - Red, raised patches resembling urticaria.
   - Lesions persist for more than 24 hours.
   - Resolution leaves bruise-like discoloration (ecchymosis).

2. **Articular Symptoms:**

   - Joint stiffness and aching, especially in wrists and knees.
   - Symptoms more pronounced in the morning.

3. **Systemic Symptoms:**

### **Part 3: Relevant Background Information**

- **Relevant Factors:**

  - Recurrent urticarial lesions triggered by cold exposure.
  - Angioedema and throat tightness suggesting systemic reactivity.

  - Recent onset of persistent urticarial lesions with atypical duration and resolution.

  - Associated joint symptoms and fatigue.

  - Family history of autoimmune disease (rheumatoid arthritis).

  - Prior adverse reaction to ibuprofen two years ago — if not identified, NSAID re-exposure could lead to drug-induced liver injury or exacerbation of vasculitis.

  - Recent onset of persistent urticarial lesions with atypical duration and resolution.

  - Associated joint symptoms and fatigue.

  - Family history of autoimmune disease (rheumatoid arthritis).

3. Have you experienced lip swelling, throat tightness, or any trouble breathing during these episodes?
4. Do the lesions resolve completely, or do they leave any discoloration or scarring?
5. Have you ever had a bad reaction to any medications — like painkillers such as ibuprofen (Advil), or even medicines you’ve taken for anxiety or sleep? This includes anything that caused rash, fatigue, upset stomach, or odd symptoms.
6. Have you noticed any symptoms after exercise, hot showers, or stress?

### **Part 7: Primary Diagnosis and Reasoning**

**Expected Primary Diagnosis:**

- **Urticarial Vasculitis**

**Key Reasoning Points:**

1. **Lesion Characteristics:**

   - Urticarial lesions persisting longer than 24 hours.
   - Post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation upon resolution.

2. **Systemic Symptoms:**

   - Joint pain and stiffness.
   - Mild fatigue.

3. **Family History:**

   - Presence of autoimmune disease in a first-degree relative.

**Common Diagnostic Pitfalls:**

- Misdiagnosing as chronic idiopathic urticaria due to superficial similarity.
- Overlooking systemic symptoms that suggest a vasculitic process.

---

### **Part 8: Differential Diagnoses and Refinement**

**Correct Differential Diagnoses:**

1. **Urticarial Vasculitis:**

   - Persistent urticarial lesions with residual hyperpigmentation.
   - Associated systemic symptoms.

2. **Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE):**

   - Can present with similar cutaneous and joint manifestations.
   - Often accompanied by other systemic features.

3. **Hypersensitivity Vasculitis:**

   - Typically related to drug exposure or infections.
   - Lesions often palpable purpura rather than urticarial.

**Incorrect Differential Diagnoses:**

1. **Chronic Idiopathic Urticaria:**

   - Lesions usually resolve within 24 hours without residual discoloration.
   - No systemic symptoms.

2. **Drug-Induced Urticarial Rash:**

   - No recent medication changes.
   - Lack of temporal relationship.

### **Part 9: Diagnostic Testing and Interpretation**

**Relevant Tests and Findings:**

- **CBC and ESR:** Mild leukocytosis, elevated ESR.
- **ANA:** Positive.
- **Complement (C3, C4):** Decreased levels.
- **Skin Biopsy:** Leukocytoclastic vasculitis with perivascular neutrophilic infiltrates and immune complex deposition.

**Irrelevant/Supporting Tests:**

- **Allergy Panel:** Negative, no new allergens identified.
- **Chest X-ray:** Normal.

---

### **Part 10: Final Diagnosis and Feedback**

**Final Diagnosis:**

- **Urticarial Vasculitis**

**Feedback:**

- **Correct Diagnosis:**

  - Identified key features: persistent hives, bruising, joint symptoms.
  - Linked systemic symptoms to autoimmune vasculitis.
  - Correctly interpreted lab and biopsy findings.

- **Incorrect Diagnosis Feedback:**

  - Chronic urticaria lacks systemic signs and bruising.
  - Drug reactions require a relevant trigger or exposure.

### **Part 11: Management & Treatment Plan**

### ⚠️ Complication Consideration:

The patient’s use of propranolol for performance anxiety is important to note. Beta-blockers may interfere with the emergency treatment of anaphylaxis by reducing the efficacy of epinephrine and increasing the severity of allergic responses.

**Management must include reviewing this medication and potentially switching to an alternative anxiolytic if needed.**
