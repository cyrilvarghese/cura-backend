### **Part 12: Management & Treatment Plan**

---

### üß™ Pre-Treatment Investigations

- **NAAT (gonorrhea \+ chlamydia):** Confirm presence of *N. gonorrhoeae* and rule out *C. trachomatis*.  
- **Culture for *N. gonorrhoeae*:** Important for antimicrobial resistance surveillance and confirmation in symptomatic patients.  
- **HIV, RPR/VDRL, HBsAg, Anti-HCV:** Screen for STI co-infections.  
- **Urinalysis:** Rule out cystitis or non-STI causes of dysuria.  
- **Medication History:** Identify recent antibiotic use or allergy.  
- **Partner Notification Readiness:** Ask about contact information for sexual partners.

---

### üîÅ Monitoring During & After Treatment

- **1 Week Post-Treatment:**  
  - **Symptom review:** Ensure complete resolution.  
- **At 3 Months:**  
  - **Repeat NAAT:** For high-risk individuals or reinfection concern.  
- **Each Visit:**  
  - **Behavioral counseling:** Condom use, reducing partner turnover.  
  - **Check partner treatment compliance:** Reduce reinfection risk.  
  - **Medication adherence check** (Doxycycline if prescribed).

---

### üíä Structured Treatment Plan

#### ‚úÖ First-Line Management (Uncomplicated Cases)

- **Ceftriaxone 500 mg IM once** (1g if ‚â•150 kg)  
- **Doxycycline 100 mg PO BID √ó 7 days** (treat coexisting *Chlamydia*)

#### ‚öñÔ∏è Escalation/Complicated Scenarios

- **Treatment failure or allergy to cephalosporins:** Use alternative regimen per sensitivity report (e.g., Gentamicin \+ Azithromycin)  
- **Disseminated gonococcal infection (DGI):** Hospitalize, initiate IV ceftriaxone 1g every 24h \+ Doxycycline

#### ‚ùå Contraindications / Drugs to Avoid

- **Ciprofloxacin:** No longer first-line due to widespread resistance  
- **Monotherapy with Doxycycline:** Not effective for gonorrhea; used only with Ceftriaxone

---

### üõ°Ô∏è Supportive & Preventive Measures

- **Sexual abstinence:** Until 7 days post-treatment and symptom-free  
- **Partner tracing and treatment:** All partners in past 60 days  
- **Printed discharge instructions** and **local STI clinic referral**  
- **Counseling on safer sex practices** (condom use, regular screening)

---

### üìà Prognosis & Long-Term Follow-Up

- **Excellent** with timely therapy  
- **Reinfection common** if partner not treated  
- Consider **repeat screening at 3 months** for all treated individuals, especially if \<25 years or high-risk sexual behavior: OSCE Stations\*\*
