### **Part 7: Primary Diagnosis**

**Expected Diagnosis:**
**Non-Gonococcal Urethritis (NGU)**

#### üß† Clinical Reasoning:

- The patient presents with **clear, mucoid discharge**, not purulent, which is a hallmark of NGU.
- **Morning drop phenomenon** is characteristic of *Chlamydia*-associated urethritis.
- \*\*NAAT positive for \*\****C. trachomatis*** confirms the diagnosis.
- No gram-negative intracellular diplococci (GNC) seen on smear rules out gonorrhea.
- No systemic symptoms or complicating features suggest an uncomplicated NGU.

#### ‚ö†Ô∏è Common Diagnostic Pitfalls:

- Failing to test for co-infections (gonorrhea, syphilis, HIV).
- Assuming all urethritis is gonococcal without NAAT confirmation.
- Not recognizing *Mycoplasma genitalium* in persistent or treatment-resistant NGU.
- Missing asymptomatic infections in sexual partners.

### **Part 8: Differential Diagnoses**

#### ‚úÖ Correct Differentials:

1. **Chlamydial urethritis** ‚Äì Most common cause of NGU; clear discharge, morning symptoms.
2. **Mycoplasma genitalium urethritis** ‚Äì Often causes persistent or recurrent NGU.
3. **Trichomonas vaginalis urethritis** ‚Äì Mucoid discharge, often in tropical settings; motile organisms seen on wet mount.

#### ‚ùå Incorrect Differentials:

1. **Gonococcal urethritis** ‚Äì Purulent, yellow-green discharge; GNC on Gram stain.
2. **Balanitis** ‚Äì Involves foreskin and glans, not urethral discharge alone.
3. **Cystitis** ‚Äì Usually associated with urinary frequency and suprapubic pain, not urethral discharge.

### **Part 9: Diagnostic Testing and Interpretation**

| Test                  | Result                        | Interpretation                            | ‚ö°Ô∏è Image     |
| --------------------- | ----------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- | ------------ |
| **Urine NAAT**        | Positive for *C. trachomatis* | Confirms NGU due to chlamydia             | No           |
| **Gram stain**        | Many WBCs, no GNC             | Consistent with NGU, rules out gonorrhea  | ‚ö°Ô∏è Mandatory |
| **Wet mount**         | No motile organisms           | Rules out *T. vaginalis*                  | ‚ö°Ô∏è Mandatory |
| **Urinalysis**        | Sterile pyuria                | Suggests inflammatory urethritis, not UTI | No           |
| **RPR, HIV, Hep B/C** | Negative                      | No co-infection detected                  | No           |

### **Part 10: Final Diagnosis and Feedback**

**Final Diagnosis:**
\*\*Non-Gonococcal Urethritis (NGU) due to \*\****Chlamydia trachomatis***

#### üîç Confirmatory Features:

- NAAT positive for *C. trachomatis*
- Absence of GNC on Gram stain
- Clinical picture matches classic NGU (clear discharge, morning worsening, dysuria)

#### üß† Feedback on Incorrect Differentials:

- **Gonococcal urethritis:** Ruled out by NAAT and absence of GNC.
- **Balanitis:** No signs of foreskin/glans involvement.
- **UTI/cystitis:** No frequency, urgency, or suprapubic pain; urinalysis sterile.

| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- | ---------------- |
| NAAT (urine or swab)      | Confirm NGU pathogens (*Chlamydia*, *Mycoplasma*) | Doxycycline      |
| HIV, RPR/VDRL, HBsAg, HCV | Co-infection screening                            | All              |

| Drug allergy history      | Screen for tetracycline allergy                   | Doxycycline      |

#### üîÅ Monitoring During & After Treatment

| Time Point | Test              | Purpose                                 | Relevant Drug(s) |
| ---------- | ----------------- | --------------------------------------- | ---------------- |
| Day 7      | Clinical review   | Confirm symptom resolution              | Doxycycline      |
| Week 2     | Partner follow-up | Confirm partner treatment adherence     | ‚Äî                |

#### üíä Structured Treatment Plan

‚úÖ **First-Line Treatment**

- **Doxycycline 100 mg PO BID √ó 7 days**
  - Preferred for *Chlamydia trachomatis* and *Mycoplasma genitalium*

‚öñÔ∏è **Second-Line / Alternative**

- **Azithromycin 1g PO single dose**
  - Alternative if doxycycline is contraindicated

‚ùå **Contraindicated / Outdated**

- **Fluoroquinolones:** Resistance high
- **Œ≤-lactams (e.g., amoxicillin):** Ineffective against intracellular organisms

#### üõ°Ô∏è Supportive & Preventive Measures

- Advise **sexual abstinence for 7 days post-treatment** and until partners are treated
- Counsel on **safer sex**, consistent **condom use**, and **routine STI screening**.  
Provide **partner notification slips** and clinic referral info.

#### üìà Prognosis & üìÖ Long-Term Plan

- High success with treatment; relapse uncommon if partners are treated.
- Recommend **test-of-cure at 3 months** for high-risk individuals.
- Provide ongoing education to reduce STI recurrence.
