### **Part 4: Physical Examinations (✳️ Image Annotations Included)**


| Exam | Notes |
|------|-------|
| Inguinal lymph node exam | Tender bubo (✳️ Image needed) |
| Genital exam | Healed ulcer (✳️ Image needed) |
| Anoscopy | Rectal discharge, ulcer (✳️ Image needed) |
| Rectal inspection | External fissures, warts (✳️ Image needed) |
| Abdominal exam | Rule out pelvic lymphadenopathy |
| Oral exam | Low yield |

### **Part 5: Lab Tests (✳️ Image Annotations Included)**


| Test | Use |
|------|-----|
| NAAT (rectal/ulcer) | Confirm C. trachomatis (✳️ Image needed) |
| PCR serovar typing | Confirm L1–L3 (✳️ Image needed) |
| Lymph node aspirate PCR | If bubo present (✳️ Image needed) |
| HIV, VDRL, TPHA | Coinfection screening |
| Gram stain | Rule out gonorrhea |
| CBC, LFTs | Baseline safety |

### **Part 6: Initial Presentation & History**


**History Questions**:
- When did symptoms begin?
- Sexual behavior, condom use?
- Known STI in partners?
- Any discharge, fever?


**Vitals**:
- Temp: 99.6°F, HR: 92 bpm, BP: Normal


**Exam Findings**:
- Right groin bubo
- Rectal tenderness and discharge
- No active ulcer, healed scar

### **Part 7: Primary Diagnosis**


**Diagnosis:** LGV (Chlamydia trachomatis L1–L3)


**Reasoning:**
- MSM + unprotected sex
- Healed ulcer → bubo → proctitis
- Confirmed by NAAT


**Pitfalls:**
- Missed painless ulcer
- Misdiagnosed as IBD or hemorrhoids


---


### **Part 8: Differentials**


**Correct:**
- HSV: painful ulcers
- Syphilis: no bubo, firm chancre
- Chancroid: painful ulcer + nodes


**Incorrect:**
- Hemorrhoids, IBS: lack STI signs
- Anal fissure: sharp pain only


---


### **Part 9: Diagnostic Testing**


| Test | Expected Result |
|------|------------------|
| NAAT | + for C. trachomatis |
| Serovar PCR | L2 positive |
| Rectal swab NAAT | + for LGV |
| HIV, VDRL | Coinfection screen |
| Gram stain | Neutrophils, no pathogens |

### **Part 10: Final Diagnosis**


**Final:** LGV (C. trachomatis, serovar L2)


**Diagnostic confirmation:**
- NAAT, proctitis symptoms, bubo


**Feedback:**
- Avoid misdiagnosing GI mimicry
- Always test site-specifically in MSM

### **Part 11: Management & Treatment Plan**


#### 🧪 Pre-Treatment Investigations


| Test | Purpose | Drug(s) |
|------|---------|---------|
| HIV, Hep B/C | Screen | Doxycycline |
| NAAT + Serotyping | Confirm diagnosis | Doxycycline |
| CBC, LFT | Baseline safety | — |


#### 🔁 Monitoring During Treatment


| Time | Test | Purpose |
|------|------|---------|
| Day 0 | Clinical + NAAT | Start baseline |
| Day 7 | Clinical review | Assess response |
| Day 21 | Clinical / NAAT | Confirm cure |
| Week 4 | Check for chronic signs | Prevent stricture |


#### 💊 Treatment


- **Doxycycline 100 mg BID x 21 days** (First line)
- **Erythromycin 500 mg QID x 21 days** (Pregnancy alternative)

#### 🛡️ Supportive Care


- Analgesics, warm compress
- Partner notification
- Sexual abstinence
- STI counseling


#### 📈 Prognosis
