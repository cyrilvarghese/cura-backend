### **Part 2: Primary Symptoms**


1. Painful erythematous nodules (ENL) on arms, legs, trunk  
2. Low-grade fever  
3. Joint pain and swelling (arthralgia/arthritis)  
4. General malaise and fatigue  
5. Eye pain or redness (possible iritis)  
6. No new anesthetic patches


---


### **Part 3: Relevant Background Information**


- No known prior diagnosis of leprosy  
- No recent infections or drugs linked to hypersensitivity  
- Likely immune complex-mediated (Type III hypersensitivity)  
- Previous compliance with MDT


---


### **Part 4: Master Physical Examination List**


- Skin exam (tender red nodules) — ⚡️ Mandatory image  
- Joint examination (swelling, tenderness, ROM)  
- Vital signs (fever)  
- Eye exam (check for iritis)  
- Palpation of peripheral nerves (may be normal)  
- Sensory exam (unchanged)


---


### **Part 5: Master Lab Test List**


- CBC (look for leukocytosis, anemia)  
- ESR, CRP (elevated in inflammation)  
- LFTs, RFTs (baseline for steroids, thalidomide)  
- Blood glucose (monitor steroid risk)  
- Slit-skin smear (track BI, not for ENL diagnosis)  
- ANA/Autoimmune screen (to rule out other causes if needed)


---


### **Part 6: History and Findings**


**Key Questions:**


- When did nodules first appear?  
- Are they painful or spreading?  
- Any fever or joint pain?  
- History of eye redness or visual issues?  
- Any prior episodes?  
- Are you compliant with MDT?


**Vitals:**


- Temp: 99.8°F  
- HR: 92 bpm  
- BP: 128/78 mmHg


**Findings:**


- Multiple erythematous, tender nodules on thighs and arms  
- Mild swelling and tenderness in wrists and knees  
- Eyes normal, no iritis  
- No new skin patches  
- Nerves not acutely tender

### **Part 7: Primary Diagnosis**


**Type 2 Reaction – Erythema Nodosum Leprosum (ENL)**


- Immune complex-mediated (Type III hypersensitivity)  
- Seen in multibacillary lepromatous cases


---


### **Part 8: Differential Diagnoses**


**Correct:**


- ENL (Type 2 Reaction)  
- Sweet Syndrome (less likely, similar skin lesions)


**Incorrect:**


- Cellulitis (usually unilateral, more localized)  
- Vasculitis (more widespread systemic involvement)  
- Drug reaction (no temporal link, no eosinophilia)


---


### **Part 9: Diagnostic Testing and Interpretation**


- **CBC:** May show neutrophilia or anemia  
- **ESR/CRP:** Elevated  
- **LFT/RFT:** Normal unless drug toxicity  
- **Blood glucose:** Monitor before steroids  
- **Slit-skin smear:** BI may remain high; no change in ENL — ⚡️ Mandatory image  
- **Autoimmune screen:** Negative (if done to rule out other inflammatory causes)


---


### **Part 10: Final Diagnosis**


**Type 2 Lepra Reaction – Erythema Nodosum Leprosum (de novo presentation)**


- Confirmed by painful nodules, fever, systemic inflammation

### **Part 12: Management & Treatment Plan**


### 🧪 Pre-Treatment and Monitoring Investigations


| Investigation | Purpose | Relevant Drug(s) |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| CBC | Detect neutrophilia/anemia | Prednisolone, Thalidomide |
| LFTs, RFTs | Baseline organ function | Prednisolone, Thalidomide |
| Blood glucose | Screen before and during steroid therapy | Prednisolone |
| Slit-skin smear | Track BI, not specific to ENL | MDT drugs |
| Pregnancy test (if female) | Thalidomide contraindication check | Thalidomide |


### 🔁 Monitoring During Reaction Treatment


| Time Point | Test | Purpose | Relevant Drug(s) |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Weekly | Clinical review | Track nodule regression, systemic symptoms | All |
| Every 2 Weeks | Blood glucose | Monitor steroid response | Prednisolone |
| Monthly | CBC, LFT | Monitor toxicity from immunosuppressives | Prednisolone, Thalidomide |
| If female | Pregnancy testing | Contraindication to thalidomide | Thalidomide |


**Treatment Protocol:**


- **Mild ENL:** NSAIDs (e.g., ibuprofen, paracetamol)  
- **Moderate to Severe ENL:**  
  - **Prednisolone 40–60 mg/day**, taper over 12 weeks  
  - **Thalidomide 100–300 mg/day** (men only, or women with strict contraception)


**Supportive Care:**


- MDT should be continued (do not stop)  
- Rest, hydration, nutritional support  
- Counseling on recurrence and symptom monitoring


**Prognosis:**


- Good with early and sustained immunomodulatory treatment  
- Risk of recurrent episodes, particularly in LL patients


**Long-Term:**


- Continue MDT  
- Monitor for recurrence or complications  
- Avoid steroids long-term if possible; consider alternative immunomodulation
