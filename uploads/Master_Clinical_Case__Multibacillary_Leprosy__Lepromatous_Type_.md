Master Clinical Case: Multibacillary Leprosy (Lepromatous Type)
Part 1: Case Description
Patient Profile:


* Age: 35 years
* Gender: Male
* Occupation: Agricultural worker
* Residence: Rural area with endemic leprosy


Chief Complaint:
The patient presents with multiple skin lesions and numbness in extremities persisting for the past 8 months.


History of Present Illness:
Approximately 8 months ago, the patient noticed several erythematous to coppery red patches and plaques on his arms and legs. These lesions gradually increased in number and size. He reports a loss of sensation over these areas, leading to accidental injuries without pain awareness. He also experiences numbness and tingling in his hands and feet, along with muscle weakness.


He notes frequent, unnoticed slipping of footwear and has a painless ulcer on his foot. Facial skin thickening, madarosis (loss of eyebrows), and nasal stuffiness have developed gradually. No similar past symptoms or treatment history.


Past Medical History: None significant.
Family History: No known leprosy or skin disease.
Social History: Long-term residence in endemic region, barefoot labor.
Review of Systems:


* Skin: Symmetrical, erythematous/coppery plaques
* Neuro: Glove-stocking anesthesia, weakness
* ENT: Nasal crusting, stuffiness
* GU: Testicular softening

Part 2: Primary Symptoms
1. Multiple erythematous to coppery plaques and nodules
2. Hypoesthesia or anesthesia over lesions
3. Glove-and-stocking peripheral sensory loss
4. Thickened peripheral nerves (ulnar, tibial)
5. Muscle weakness and wasting (claw hand)
6. Madarosis (loss of lateral eyebrows)
7. Painless plantar ulcer
8. Nasal stuffiness, crusting, epistaxis
9. Ear lobe infiltration and thickening
10. Leonine facies (thickened facial skin)
11. Nasal voice
12. Testicular atrophy
13. Slipping of footwear unnoticed due to sensory loss

Part 7: Primary Diagnosis
Multibacillary Leprosy – Lepromatous Type


* Multiple symmetrical plaques with sensory loss
* Peripheral nerve thickening
* Systemic and mucosal signs
* High bacillary load on smear and biopsy


________________


Part 8: Differential Diagnoses
Correct:


* Borderline Lepromatous Leprosy
* Histoid Leprosy


Incorrect:


* Vitiligo
* Tinea corporis
* Cutaneous Leishmaniasis
* Lupus, Sarcoidosis


________________


Part 9: Diagnostic Testing and Interpretation
* Slit-skin smear: +AFB (BI 5+) — ⚡️ Mandatory image
* Biopsy: Virchow cells, Fite stain + — ⚡️ Mandatory image
* PCR: Confirms diagnosis, detects resistance
* Nerve conduction: Slowed velocity
* CBC/LFT/RFT: Baseline for MDT safety
* HIV test: Rule out coinfection


________________


Part 10: Final Diagnosis
Multibacillary Leprosy (Lepromatous Type)


* Based on classical clinical signs, neural involvement, and positive smear/histology


Feedback:


* Differentials ruled out due to absence of localized ulcer (Leishmaniasis), nerve sparing (Vitiligo), etc.

Part 12: Management & Treatment Plan
WHO MDT Regimen (12 months):


* Rifampicin 600 mg once monthly (supervised)
* Clofazimine 300 mg monthly + 50 mg daily
* Dapsone 100 mg daily


Reaction Management:


* ENL: Prednisolone 40-60 mg/day, taper; Thalidomide if needed (men only)


Supportive:


* Protective footwear
* Wound care
* Physiotherapy for hand/foot function
* Reconstructive surgery if needed


Long-Term:


* Contact tracing
* Adherence checks
* Monitor for relapse and reactions
