## Master Clinical Case: Tuberculoid Leprosy


### **Part 1: Case Description**


**Patient Profile:**


- Age: 28 years  
- Gender: Female  
- Occupation: School teacher  
- Residence: Semi-urban area in a leprosy-endemic region


**Chief Complaint:**  
The patient presents with a single large hypopigmented patch on the left upper arm and altered skin sensation for 3 months.


**History of Present Illness:**  
The patient noticed a well-demarcated, hypopigmented patch on the outer side of her left upper arm approximately 3 months ago. The lesion was non-itchy, painless, and gradually increased in size. She recently observed reduced sensation to touch and temperature over the lesion.


No history of trauma, insect bite, or new cosmetic use. She denies systemic symptoms like fever or weight loss. No similar lesions elsewhere.


**Past Medical History:** None  
**Family History:** No known leprosy or dermatologic illness  
**Social History:** Lives with family, no known contacts with leprosy. Practices good hygiene.


**Review of Systems:**


- Skin: Single hypopigmented patch  
- Neurological: Localized sensory loss over lesion  
- General: No fever, malaise, or weight loss

### **Part 2: Primary Symptoms**


1. Single hypopigmented macule or patch  
2. Sharply demarcated margins  
3. Complete loss of sensation (touch, pain, temperature) over the patch  
4. Hair loss over the lesion  
5. Dry skin over lesion  
6. Thickened peripheral nerve near the lesion (usually non-tender)  
7. Absence of systemic symptoms  
8. No mucosal involvement

### **Part 3: Relevant Background Information**


- Residence in endemic zone  
- No systemic illness  
- No family or close contact with diagnosed leprosy  
- No diabetes, HIV, or autoimmune conditions


---


### **Part 4: Master Physical Examination List**


- Skin exam (macule with clear border) — ⚡️ Mandatory image  
- Sensory testing over lesion (cotton, pinprick, warm/cold object)  
- Peripheral nerve palpation (especially radial cutaneous or ulnar)  
- Hair density over patch  
- Reflex testing (normal)  
- Eye, ENT, oral mucosa exams (normal)  
- Systemic exam (non-contributory)


---


### **Part 5: Master Lab Test List**


- Slit-skin smear (expected negative)  
- Skin biopsy with Fite-Faraco stain — ⚡️ Mandatory image  
- Lepromin test (expected strongly positive)  
- CBC, LFT, RFT (for MDT safety)  
- Fasting glucose  
- HIV test  
- Nerve conduction study (if extensive nerve thickening suspected)

### **Part 6: History and Findings**


**Key Questions:**


- When did the patch first appear?  
- Any change in size or number of lesions?  
- Have you experienced reduced sensation?  
- Any prior skin issues or contact with known leprosy patients?


**Vitals:** Normal


**Findings:**


- Single well-demarcated hypopigmented patch on left upper arm  
- No tenderness or discharge  
- Complete sensory loss over lesion  
- Localized nerve thickening  
- No signs of systemic or mucosal involvement

### **Part 7: Primary Diagnosis**


**Paucibacillary Leprosy – Tuberculoid Type**


- Single skin lesion with clear margins  
- Complete sensory loss  
- Peripheral nerve thickening  
- Slit-skin smear negative, lepromin test positive


---


### **Part 8: Differential Diagnoses**


**Correct:**


- Indeterminate leprosy (if lesion was vague, early)


**Incorrect:**


- Vitiligo (no sensory loss, sharp margins)  
- Pityriasis alba (mild, itchy, not anesthetic)  
- Tinea versicolor (scaly, itchy, positive KOH)  
- Psoriasis (scaly, erythematous plaques)


---


### **Part 9: Diagnostic Testing and Interpretation**


- **Slit-skin smear:** Negative (as expected in TT) — ⚡️ Mandatory image  
- **Biopsy:** Granulomatous inflammation with epithelioid cells, few or no bacilli — ⚡️ Mandatory image  
- **Lepromin test:** Strongly positive (indicative of robust cell-mediated immunity)  
- **Nerve conduction:** Normal or mild slowing  
- **Other labs:** CBC, LFT, RFT normal; HIV negative

### **Part 10: Final Diagnosis**


**Paucibacillary Leprosy – Tuberculoid Type**


- Based on clinical and histological findings, with strong host immunity

### **Part 12: Management & Treatment Plan**


### 🧪 Pre-Treatment and Post-Treatment Investigations


| Investigation | Purpose | Relevant Drug(s) |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| CBC | Detect anemia or blood dyscrasias | Dapsone |
| LFTs | Assess liver function before starting MDT | Rifampicin, Clofazimine |
| RFTs | Baseline renal status | Clofazimine |
| Fasting Blood Glucose | Rule out baseline diabetes | General, especially with steroids |
| HIV Test | Screen for immunosuppression | All MDT drugs |
| Slit-skin smear | Diagnostic baseline | — |
| Skin Biopsy (Fite-Faraco) | Confirm histopathology | — |
| Nerve Conduction Study | Document baseline nerve status | General |


### 🔁 Monitoring During and After Treatment


| Time Point | Investigation | Purpose | Relevant Drug(s) |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Monthly | Clinical exam \+ lesion check | Track response to therapy | All |
|  | Sensory and motor testing | Detect new nerve involvement | All |
|  | Pill count / adherence check | Ensure compliance | All |
| Every 3 Months | CBC \+ LFTs | Detect toxicity | Dapsone, Rifampicin, Clofazimine |
| If Symptomatic | Methemoglobin level | Rule out rare dapsone side effect (cyanosis, dyspnea) | Dapsone |
|  | Eye exam | Detect clofazimine pigmentation | Clofazimine |


**WHO MDT Regimen (Paucibacillary, updated 2023 WHO recommendation):**


- **Rifampicin 600 mg** once monthly (supervised)  
- **Clofazimine 300 mg** once monthly (supervised)  
- **Clofazimine 50 mg** every other day (self-administered)  
- **Dapsone 100 mg** daily (self-administered)


**Monitoring:**


- Monthly check of lesion response and nerve function  
- Educate patient on adherence and early reporting of reactions


**Prognosis:**


- Excellent if diagnosed early  
- Rare risk of reaction or deformity in pure TT form


**Long-Term:**


- Yearly follow-up for relapse monitoring  
- Family screening for early signs in household contacts
