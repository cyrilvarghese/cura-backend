### Medical Case: Plasmodium falciparum Malaria (Uncomplicated)


#### **Part 1: Case Description**


A 27-year-old male presents to the emergency department with a four-day history of high-grade fever accompanied by chills, sweating, and fatigue. He reports recent travel to a malaria-endemic region in sub-Saharan Africa for work. He also complains of intermittent headaches, nausea, and muscle aches. On further inquiry, he denies any significant past medical history, medication use, or allergies. He notes that his symptoms started approximately 12 days after returning from his trip.


On examination, the patient appears lethargic but responsive. He is febrile with a temperature of 39.5°C (103.1°F), tachycardic with a pulse rate of 105 bpm, and normotensive. Pallor is noted on conjunctival examination, and there is mild splenomegaly on abdominal palpation.

#### **Part 7: Primary Diagnosis and Reasoning**


**Expected Primary Diagnosis:**


- **Plasmodium falciparum malaria (uncomplicated)**


**Key Reasoning Points:**


1. **Travel History:** The patient recently visited a malaria-endemic region in sub-Saharan Africa, a known risk factor for malaria.  
2. **Incubation Period:** Symptoms began 12 days post-travel, aligning with the incubation period for *P. falciparum*.  
3. **Classic Malaria Symptoms:** Fever with chills and sweating, fatigue, headache, and muscle aches are hallmark features of malaria.  
4. **Physical Findings:** Presence of splenomegaly and pallor, commonly associated with malaria.  
5. **Ruling Out Other Conditions:** Lack of rashes or joint pain reduces the likelihood of alternative diagnoses such as dengue or chikungunya.


**Common Errors to Anticipate:**


1. Misdiagnosing as viral fever without considering travel history and epidemiologic exposure.  
2. Overlooking malaria due to absence of severe symptoms such as altered mental status or organ dysfunction.  
3. Failing to perform confirmatory diagnostic tests like blood smear or RDT.

#### **Part 8: Differential Diagnoses and Refinement**


**Curated Differential Diagnoses:**


1. **Correct Options (Including Primary Diagnosis):**  
     
   - **Plasmodium falciparum malaria (Primary Diagnosis):** Fits the clinical presentation, including travel history, febrile illness, and splenomegaly.  
   - **Dengue Fever:** Common in endemic regions and presents with fever, but typically associated with rash, severe myalgia, and a positive tourniquet test.  
   - **Typhoid Fever:** Febrile illness in endemic areas, characterized by abdominal pain, bradycardia, and a stepwise fever pattern.


   


2. **Incorrect Options:**  
     
   - **Chikungunya Fever:** Although endemic, usually presents with rash and debilitating arthritis, which are absent in this case.  
   - **Leptospirosis:** Can mimic malaria but typically includes conjunctival suffusion and severe muscle tenderness, not observed here.  
   - **Viral Hemorrhagic Fever:** Rare and associated with petechiae and bleeding diathesis, which are not present in this patient.


**Explanations for Differential Diagnoses:**


1. **Plasmodium falciparum malaria:** The most plausible diagnosis given the travel history, symptom pattern, and physical findings.  
2. **Dengue Fever:** Less likely due to absence of rash, severe muscle aches, and bleeding signs, but it remains a differential due to overlapping symptoms.  
3. **Typhoid Fever:** Fever with abdominal pain could mimic malaria, but lack of gastrointestinal symptoms or bradycardia makes this less probable.  
4. **Chikungunya Fever:** The absence of a rash or joint involvement effectively rules this out.  
5. **Leptospirosis:** Unlikely due to lack of conjunctival suffusion or severe muscle tenderness.  
6. **Viral Hemorrhagic Fever:** Rare and not supported by the clinical picture or exposure history.

#### **Part 9: Diagnostic Testing and Interpretation**


**Relevant Lab Tests and Expected Results:**


1. **Blood Smear (Thick and Thin):**  
   - *Expected Result:* Presence of *P. falciparum* trophozoites and/or gametocytes. High parasite density in severe cases.  
2. **Rapid Diagnostic Test (RDT):**  
   - *Expected Result:* Positive for *P. falciparum*\-specific antigens (e.g., HRP2).  
3. **Complete Blood Count (CBC):**  
   - *Expected Result:* Anemia (low hemoglobin), thrombocytopenia, mild leukopenia.  
4. **Liver Function Tests (LFTs):**  
   - *Expected Result:* Elevated bilirubin due to hemolysis, normal to mildly elevated liver enzymes.  
5. **Renal Function Tests:**  
   - *Expected Result:* Normal to mildly elevated creatinine, depending on hydration status.  
6. **Blood Glucose:**  
   - *Expected Result:* Normal to low; hypoglycemia may indicate severe malaria.  
7. **Arterial Blood Gas (ABG):**  
   - *Expected Result:* Normal or metabolic acidosis in severe cases.  
8. **Coagulation Profile:**  
   - *Expected Result:* Normal in uncomplicated cases, abnormal in severe cases with DIC.  
9. **Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate (ESR):**  
   - *Expected Result:* Elevated, indicating systemic inflammation.  
10. **Urinalysis:**  
- *Expected Result:* Hemoglobinuria in severe malaria, normal in uncomplicated cases.


**Optional Additional Tests:**


- **Serology for Dengue or Typhoid Fever:** To rule out overlapping tropical diseases.  
- **Chest X-ray:** If respiratory symptoms develop, to exclude ARDS or pneumonia.

#### **Part 10: Final Diagnosis and Feedback**


**Final Diagnosis:**


- **Plasmodium falciparum malaria (uncomplicated)**


**Key Supporting Evidence:**


1. **Clinical Features:** High-grade fever with chills and sweating, fatigue, headache, and splenomegaly—all classic signs of malaria.  
2. **Travel History:** Recent visit to a malaria-endemic region with onset of symptoms consistent with the incubation period.  
3. **Laboratory Findings:** (Hypothetical based on expectations) Blood smear confirming *P. falciparum* trophozoites and RDT positivity.


**Feedback for Correct Diagnosis:**


- **Strong Points:** Identifying the hallmark features of malaria, recognizing the importance of travel history, and linking symptoms to the incubation period.  
- **Reinforcing Pathophysiology:** This diagnosis involves the erythrocytic cycle of *P. falciparum*, causing red blood cell rupture, systemic inflammation, and splenomegaly.  
- **Encouraging Confidence:** The logical approach to integrating travel history with symptomatology and laboratory confirmation demonstrates excellent diagnostic reasoning.


**Feedback for Incorrect Diagnoses:**


1. **Dengue Fever:** Highlight the absence of a rash, tourniquet test positivity, or severe myalgia to differentiate it from malaria.  
2. **Typhoid Fever:** Emphasize the lack of abdominal pain, diarrhea, or bradycardia as distinguishing features.  
3. **Chikungunya Fever:** Point out the absence of rash or joint swelling, which are key features of chikungunya.  
4. **Leptospirosis:** Absence of conjunctival suffusion or severe myalgia helps rule this out.  
5. **Viral Hemorrhagic Fever:** Unlikely due to no bleeding diathesis or high-risk exposure.
