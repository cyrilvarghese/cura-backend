## 🧾 Case: Primary Syphilis in an HIV-Positive Female


---


### **Part 1: Case Description**


**Patient:** Ms. Sangeeta R., a 25-year-old unmarried female with known HIV-positive status (on ART, last CD4 410 cells/µL), presents to the STI clinic with a **painless genital ulcer** she first noticed **10 days ago**.


The lesion started as a small bump near the vaginal opening and evolved into a single, round, indurated, **non-tender ulcer** with a clean base. She denies any pain, itching, or discharge. She reports **unprotected vaginal and oral sex with a new male partner** 4 weeks prior to onset. She has never been treated for syphilis or other STIs.


No fever, rashes, lymph node pain, or systemic complaints. No history of trauma, new medications, or autoimmune conditions.


She is **on first-line ART (TLD regimen)**, virally suppressed as of last month. Last menstrual period was 2 weeks ago. No current pregnancy.

- No fever, no travel, no autoimmune history
- No new meds or trauma
- Menstrual history normal

### **Part 4: Physical Examination**


| Exam | Finding | Image Needed |
|------|---------|--------------|
| External genitalia | Single, clean-based, painless chancre | ✅ Mandatory |
| Inguinal nodes | Bilateral, non-tender | ❌ |
| Oral cavity | Normal | ❌ |
| Skin (palms, soles) | No rash | ❌ |
| Speculum | No cervical lesion | ❌ |
| Bimanual | No CMT or adnexal mass | ❌ |

### **Part 5: Lab Tests (with distractors)**


| Test | Expected Result | Relevance | Image Needed |
|------|------------------|-----------|--------------|
| RPR (quantitative) | Reactive (e.g., 1:8) | ✅ | ✅ |
| TPHA/FTA-ABS | Positive | ✅ | ❌ |
| Dark-field microscopy | Spirochetes seen | ✅ | ✅ |
| HIV VL, CD4 | VL suppressed, CD4 410 | ✅ | ❌ |
| CSF VDRL (if neuro signs or RPR ≥1:32) | Negative (if done) | ✅ (conditional) | ❌ |
| NAAT: GC/CT | Negative | ✅ (screening) | ❌ |
| Urine R/M, ESR, Pap smear, Mantoux | Normal | ❌ | ❌ |

### **Part 6: History-Taking & Clinical Findings**


#### History Questions:
- When did you notice the ulcer?
- Is it painful or itchy?
- Have you had new sexual partners recently?
- Are you on ART and taking it regularly?


#### Vitals:
- Temp: 98.6°F
- BP: 112/74
- HR: 82 bpm
- RR: 16
- SpO2: 99%


#### Physical Exam:
- Single painless ulcer on left labia
- Bilateral non-tender inguinal nodes
- No systemic signs

### **Part 7: Diagnosis and Clinical Reasoning**


**Diagnosis:** Primary Syphilis (with HIV)


| Feature | Interpretation |
|---------|----------------|
| Painless chancre | Classic for syphilis |
| Non-tender nodes | Consistent with primary stage |
| Recent sexual contact | Exposure window matches incubation |
| Positive RPR + TPHA | Diagnostic |
| HIV+ | Higher risk of atypical presentation or neurosyphilis |


---


### **Part 8: Differential Diagnoses**


| Condition | Why Considered | Why Ruled Out |
|----------|----------------|---------------|
| HSV | Genital ulcer | Painful, vesicular, recurrent |
| Chancroid | Ulcer + nodes | Painful, ragged ulcer, suppurative nodes |
| LGV | Ulcer + HIV | Usually presents later with painful buboes |
| Granuloma inguinale | Painless ulcer | Bleeds easily, beefy red, rare |


---


### **Part 9: Diagnostic Interpretation**


| Test | Result | Interpretation |
|------|--------|----------------|
| RPR | Reactive, 1:8 | Monitor titer post-treatment |
| TPHA | Positive | Confirms treponemal exposure |
| Dark-field | Spirochetes seen | Definitive |
| CD4 | 410 | Mild immunosuppression |
| CSF VDRL | Not indicated (no neuro signs) | Observation only |


---


### **Part 10: Final Diagnosis & Feedback**


**Primary Syphilis in HIV-positive female**


- Serology + ulcer appearance confirms it
- No CNS signs; no CSF testing required now
- HIV status demands closer follow-up


**Feedback:** Avoid misdiagnosing HSV; always test HIV+ patients for syphilis and vice versa.

### **Part 11: Management & Treatment Plan (HIV+)**


#### 🧪 Pre-Treatment Investigations


| Investigation | Purpose | Drug(s) |
|---------------|---------|---------|
| RPR | Baseline titer | Benzathine Penicillin G |
| CD4 + VL | HIV monitoring | Not for syphilis treatment, but essential |
| CSF VDRL (if RPR ≥1:32 or neuro signs) | Rule out neurosyphilis | IV Penicillin if positive |
| Urine β-hCG | Rule out pregnancy | Doxy contraindicated if positive |


---


#### 🔁 Monitoring During Treatment


| Time Point | Test | Purpose |
|------------|------|---------|
| 3 months | RPR titer | Check ≥4-fold drop |
| 6 months | RPR + CD4 | Evaluate response + HIV follow-up |
| 12 months | RPR | Final check |
| Any time | CSF VDRL if neuro signs emerge | Evaluate for neurosyphilis |


---


#### 💊 Treatment Protocol


| Case Type | Treatment |
|-----------|-----------|
| Primary Syphilis (HIV+) | **Benzathine Penicillin G 2.4M IU IM x 1 dose** |
| If Penicillin Allergic | **Doxycycline 100 mg BID x 14 days** (only if CD4 >350) |
| If Pregnant | **Penicillin, desensitize if allergic** |


---


#### 🛡️ Supportive Care


- Counseling on partner testing
- Abstain from sex until lesion resolves
- Condom promotion
- ART adherence support
- HAV/HBV vaccination if not immune


---


#### 📈 Prognosis & Follow-Up


| Plan | Notes |
|------|-------|
| Excellent prognosis | If treated early |
| RPR titers | Monitor at 3, 6, 12 months |
| Neurosyphilis vigilance | If slow titer decline or neuro symptoms |
| Partner testing | Essential for STI control |
