Part 7: Primary Diagnosis
Diagnosis: Uncomplicated Vulvovaginal Candidiasis

* Normal vaginal pH
* Pseudohyphae on KOH mount
* Absence of systemic signs

________________


Part 8: Differential Diagnoses
Correct:


* Bacterial vaginosis
* Trichomoniasis
* Contact dermatitis (irritant/allergic)


Incorrect:


* PID – no systemic signs or lower abdominal pain
* UTI – no urgency, frequency, or suprapubic tenderness
* Cervicitis – no mucopurulent cervical discharge or STI risk


________________


Part 9: Test Interpretation
Expected Findings:


* KOH: Pseudohyphae, budding yeast – confirms Candida
* pH: 4.0 – normal
* Whiff test: Negative – rules out BV
* Wet mount: Yeast cells + inflammatory cells
* RBS: Normal
* Cervical NAAT: Not needed

* Non-albicans Candida: Boric acid 600 mg intravaginal capsules × 14 days
* Severe symptomatic VVC: Fluconazole 150 mg on Day 1 and Day 4


❌ Contraindicated


* Oral fluconazole in pregnancy (risk of birth defects)
* Steroid creams for itching (may worsen fungal infection)
* Routine partner treatment (only if symptomatic)


________________


🛡️ Supportive & Preventive Measures
* Avoid tight clothing, scented soaps, and douching
* Use breathable cotton underwear
* Improve glycemic control (if diabetic)
* Educate on antibiotic-related risk and recurrence
* Partner treatment only if symptomatic
